# Git Worktrees

Place every worktree in the **sibling** directory `../rocknix.worktrees/`, one subdirectory
per branch, named after the branch leaf. That directory lives next to the primary checkout
(outside the repo tree), so it never needs gitignoring.

The **primary checkout** `/workspace/repos/rocknix` stays a reflection of the canonical branch —
here that is **`next`**, the fork's integration branch (this repo has **no `main`**; `origin`
and `upstream` both default to `next`). Do feature work in worktrees, not the primary checkout.

```
/workspace/repos/                 # serval's dedicated build volume; see device-builds.md
├── rocknix/                    # primary checkout — stays on next (the "main" reflection)
└── rocknix.worktrees/
    ├── rclone-cleanup/         # branch: feature/rclone-cleanup
    └── <name>/                 # branch: feature/<name>
```

The worktree directory leaf is the branch name **minus the `feature/` prefix** (the prefix
carries a slash, so it can't be a directory leaf). Branches still use the `feature/<name>`
convention required by the fork workflow (see `fork-workflow.md`).

## Build worktrees are on `build/*` branches, never detached

`scripts/image` writes `BUILD_BRANCH="$(git branch --show-current)"` into
`/etc/os-release`, and `rocknix-info` shows it to the player as
`BUILD ID: cb50b45 (test/qa-integration)`. On a detached HEAD that command
returns **empty**, so an image built from a detached worktree ships with a blank
branch field and an empty parenthetical on the device's info screen. Detached is
fine for reading; it is not fine for building.

Git will not check out the same branch in two worktrees, and the primary
checkout holds `next`. So each build worktree gets its own branch named after
its directory — `build/devices`, `build/generic-x64` — which keeps
`BUILD_BRANCH` populated and says which checkout produced an image.

A branch does not follow `next` on its own any more than a detached HEAD does:

```bash
./tools/fork-worktree sync     # fast-forward every build/* worktree to next
```

It touches only `build/*` branches, skips a worktree with uncommitted changes
rather than overwriting it, and is fast-forward-only — a build branch someone
committed on has diverged, and quietly rewriting it would lose that work.

**Never sync a worktree with a build in flight.** `calculate_stamp` hashes each
package directory *when that package is reached*, so a fast-forward under a
running build makes every package after that moment build from the new tree
and every package before it from the old — a mixed image, with no error and a
`BUILD_ID` that names only one of the two. It happened on 2026-09-04: `rclone`
(seq 632) picked up commits landed mid-build while the other 660 packages did
not. Benign that time because the late commits touched only `rclone`; the next
time it will not be. Check for a running build before `sync`, and if one is up, wait -- with
`pgrep -f 'make docker-[A-Z]'`, not `docker ps | grep rocknix-build`: the build
containers carry random names (`jolly_turing`), so that grep answered zero all
day on 2026-09-13 while an SM8550 build ran. While a device build is in flight,
fast-forward another build worktree by hand (`git -C <worktree> merge --ff-only
next`) rather than with `sync`, which walks every build worktree at once.

It deliberately takes **no target argument**. It walks every build worktree at
once, so an arbitrary ref moves all of them together; while this function was
being tested, a throwaway commit was fast-forwarded onto two real build
checkouts exactly that way, and went unnoticed because the test only read the
output line it expected. `next` is the only ref worth following here.

## One builder per build worktree

A build worktree is a single mutable thing: one checked-out tree, one
`target/` whose image file name carries only the date, and one
`package.mk` whose ES pin a stream may edit without committing. Two
streams building there in the same hour cannot both be right. On
2026-09-14 the #179 and #181 streams did exactly that in `generic-x64`,
three minutes apart: the second build inherited the first's uncommitted ES
pin edit, wrote an image whose `BUILD_ID` named one stream's distribution
and whose EmulationStation was the other's, overwrote the first stream's
image under the same file name, and its `git checkout -- package.mk`
cleanup discarded the first stream's edit. Neither build failed.

So: **subagents deliver branches; the integrator builds.** A brief that
sends an agent to build an image says which worktree is its alone, and
nothing else builds there until it reports. An uncommitted pin edit in a
build worktree belongs to whoever is building right now and to nobody
after; commit the pin on a throwaway `build/*` branch instead, so `git
status` shows whose tree it is. Read `target/`'s file time and the image's
`/etc/os-release` before trusting an image you did not watch being built.

## Removing a worktree

**Use `tools/fork-worktree remove`, not `git worktree remove`.**

Worktrees here are not interchangeable. A feature worktree is a few hundred MB
of checkout that a clone can rebuild in seconds. A build worktree holds
`build.ROCKNIX-<DEVICE>.<ARCH>` directories, `sources/` and `target/` — hours of
compilation each, none of it in git, none of it recoverable. `git worktree
remove --force` cannot tell those apart, and `--force` is precisely the flag you
reach for when the first attempt complains.

It is also not atomic. Told to force-remove a worktree holding hundreds of GB,
git has been observed to unregister it and leave the contents behind: a
directory that is no longer a worktree, with orphaned build roots, reported only
as a non-zero exit. In a loop over several worktrees that exit scrolls past.

An approved forced removal first inspects directory permissions. Go module
caches contain owner-owned read-only directories; Git otherwise discovers
them only after partially deleting and unregistering the worktree (#460).
The helper adds owner write/search bits only where needed, after a complete
scan, without following directory symlinks or changing regular-file modes.
Unreadable, unrepairable or cross-filesystem directories stop the operation
before Git removal. Keep a failed run's receipt; repair a partial worktree
with the preserved commit and tracked diff, then use a fresh retry owner.

```bash
./tools/fork-worktree list                        # what each one is holding
./tools/fork-worktree remove <path>               # refuses if build output is present
./tools/fork-worktree remove <path> --preserve <dir>
./tools/fork-worktree remove <path> --force       # only after it has told you what dies
./tools/fork-worktree repair <path>               # re-register an orphaned directory
```

`repair` exists because git's own `worktree repair` cannot help once the admin
directory under `.git/worktrees/` has been pruned — it re-creates the worktree in
place and carries every untracked file back.

**Never remove the worktree you are standing in.** The shell's working directory
vanishes mid-command and everything afterwards fails for an unrelated-looking
reason. Detach it instead (`git switch --detach`) if you only need its branch
freed; the tool refuses this case outright.

## Review retention after qualification

A successful build followed by its required QA triggers a **retention review**
(D-INFRA-018, #461). Before the next build, compare available space with its
build, independent-copy and QA footprint plus a measured margin; filesystem
reserve is not build headroom. Compiler success alone does not release an old
candidate. This review is infrastructure work, not a new RC acceptance gate.

Keep the current candidate and useful rebuild tree, a qualified fallback for
each device/architecture, the ROCKNIX upgrade baseline, exact source/licence
inputs, the shared source cache, and failure evidence. Protect their transitive
dependencies: qcow2 backing chains and objects referenced across preservation
stores count even when their original run failed. Independent, verified copies
of compact evidence can replace an otherwise unnecessary full build tree.

The next cleanup report names exact proposed removals, protected identities,
dependency checks, preservation cost, expected net recovery and next-build
headroom. Inspect active host processes and container mounts before execution;
unreadable or unclassified dependencies prevent a removal proposal. Use the
standard guarded worktree helper and watched owner for an authorized batch,
then verify removal, retained inputs and actual free space. A retention review
never extends an earlier batch's deletion scope. #461 tracks the repeatable
planner and first later batch; automatic cleanup is not implemented.

## Create a worktree + branch from next

Always branch from the latest `next` — fetch first so the personal overlay (instruction
files, `plans/`, work logs) is present while you work:

```bash
# run from the primary checkout
git fetch upstream
git switch next && git merge --ff-only upstream/next   # keep next current (optional)
git worktree add ../rocknix.worktrees/<name> -b feature/<name> next
```

To resume an **existing** feature branch in a worktree, omit `-b`:

```bash
git worktree add ../rocknix.worktrees/<name> feature/<name>
```

## Manage worktrees

```bash
./tools/fork-worktree list                              # what each one is holding
./tools/fork-worktree remove ../rocknix.worktrees/<name>  # delete when finished
git worktree prune                                      # clean up stale entries
```

`git worktree list` still reads fine; `git worktree remove` does not, for the
reason § "Removing a worktree" gives -- it cannot tell a few hundred MB of
checkout from hours of un-recoverable build output.

## Rules

1. **One worktree per branch**, under `../rocknix.worktrees/`, named after the branch leaf.
2. **Branch from `next`** (fetched fresh) unless a task explicitly requires another base —
   `next` carries the personal overlay, so instructions are present while you work.
3. **Keep the primary checkout on `next`** (the "main" reflection); do feature work in worktrees.
4. **Keep worktrees as siblings** — never nest one inside the primary checkout.
5. **Remove with `./tools/fork-worktree remove`** (never `rm -rf`, and never plain
   `git worktree remove --force`) so git metadata stays consistent *and* build output
   is not destroyed without being named first -- see § "Removing a worktree".
6. Opening a clean upstream PR from a worktree still follows `fork-workflow.md`:
   `pr/<name>` is built **by content** from `upstream/next` --
   `git checkout next -- <the feature paths>`, one commit. The old
   `git rebase --onto upstream/next next pr/<name>` recipe is retired: once the
   feature is merged into `next` (which is where it has to go to be built and QA'd),
   `next..pr/<name>` is empty and the rebase silently produces a PR branch with
   nothing in it.
