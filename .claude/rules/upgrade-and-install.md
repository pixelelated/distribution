# Upgrade and clean install

ROCKNIX is an immutable OS that people **update in place**, keeping `/storage`.
So every change lands on two populated devices at once: one that has been
running the previous version, and one flashed fresh. A change that only works on
the machine it was developed on is not finished.

**Run this before publishing a build**, not after a tester finds the gap.

## The two questions

For every change in the build, answer both:

1. **Upgrade** — a device running the previous version updates to this one,
   keeping its `/storage`. What does it already have that this change did not
   anticipate: an older config file, an artifact written by the old code, a
   setting under a name we stopped using, a marker file nobody consumes any more?
2. **Clean install** — a freshly flashed device with no `/storage` history. What
   does this change assume exists that only exists because a previous version
   created it?

## What to check, by kind of change

| Changed | Ask |
|---|---|
| A config option | Is it in **both** `*.conf` and `*.conf.defaults` (with the `DEFAULT_` prefix)? `cloud_sync_helper` only appends what is missing, so an option absent from defaults never reaches an upgraded device. |
| An **artifact format** (archive, manifest, save layout) | Can the new code still read what the old code wrote? This is the one that bites — see below. |
| A settings key | Does the old key still exist on upgraded devices? Renaming a key silently resets everyone's preference. |
| A script's flags or output | Anything parsing it — hooks, ES, other scripts — may still be the old version until its own package rebuilds. |
| A marker/sentinel file | Is there still a consumer? An orphaned marker sits forever; a missing one silently disables a flow. |
| A menu entry that moved | Nothing persists, but check two things. Does a *second* path to the same operation now exist? Two entries doing almost the same thing is how someone gets a backup missing what they assumed was in it. And does any **string still name the old path**? Grep the old menu names: help text, error messages and post-restore advice hard-code them, and a message that sends someone to a menu that no longer holds anything is a dead end at the moment they most need the instruction. |
| A file the OS provides (symlink, seeded config) | Does the change assume it is a regular file? |

## Fixing forward is not enough

The trap worth naming, because it already caught us: **a fix that changes what
we write does nothing for what is already written.**

`358eb53d3f` stopped backups from capturing the contents of symlinked paths. It
did not help any backup already on a device or in someone's cloud — those still
held a regular file where the device has a symlink, and busybox unzip aborts the
whole restore when it meets one. Fixed forward, still broken backward, and the
broken ones were everybody's. The restore side needed its own fix
(`02297b9c07`).

So when a format changes, ask separately:

- Does new code read **old** data? (compatibility)
- Does old code read **new** data? (a downgrade, or a device that has not updated yet)
- Does anything need to be **migrated**, and can that migration be interrupted?

## Every fix answers what was already written (D-WORKFLOW-050)

The section above was written in July and broken in September with every
ceremony observed. #280 fixed the launcher's log and the reader of it, had
a code trace, a VM proof and a staged candidate -- and the rotation records
the old reader had already written stayed wrong on the device until each
game was played again (#288; the register row even said so, as if it were
fine). Maintainer, 2026-09-26: *"We should make sure that when we push a
fix, we ensure parity for the existing system to leverage any new
functionality. [...] This would have caught the need to rotate existing
files if we'd followed this policy in place."*

So the question is asked of every fix, in writing, and checked. A bug's
code trace (#273; `release-candidates.md` step 0) carries a sixth part:

```
Already written: <what the code before the fix had written on devices and
in their clouds> -- read both | migrated: <how> | nothing inherited: <why>
```

- **Read both, write the new one** is the answer to reach for (the next
  section): the new code reads the old shape and writes a new one it can
  tell apart. #288's answer: a record without `from=own-launch` is not
  trusted, the core's table stands in, the next exit rewrites it.
- **Migrated** names the migration (§ Migrations: non-destructive,
  idempotent, interruptible) and adds the migrated piece to
  `tools/vm-upgrade-rehearsal`'s seeds, so the next candidate proves it.
- **Nothing inherited** is argued, not assumed: the old code wrote nothing
  this fix reads. A record, a stamp, a config key, an archive, a cached
  answer, a file name -- each is something the old code may have left.

`tools/rc-preflight`'s `already written` item reads every open bug with a
code trace and every bug closed as completed since 2026-09-26 02:45 UTC,
and a trace without the line is a finding: the tree is not a candidate
(#289). Proven to fire on 2026-09-26 against #288's trace before the line
was added, and to pass once it was (work log, 03:05 UTC).

## An upgrade should be invisible

Before deciding a change needs a migration, or a prompt, or a release note, ask
whether the code can simply handle both shapes. In that order:

1. **Read both, write the new one.** The old layout keeps working, new writes
   land in the new place, and the data migrates itself as it is touched. Nobody
   is told anything because nothing happened to them.
2. **Ask, only if step 1 genuinely cannot work** — the shapes are
   irreconcilable, or the choice is really the owner's to make.
3. **A release note is never a mitigation.** It is a record for people who go
   looking, not a control. Assume it is unread.

**A prompt is a failure mode, not a solution.** Asking somebody about a setting
they never chose and have never heard of is only marginally better than the
breakage it replaces — they still have to form an opinion about our internals
to get back to playing a game.

The case that produced this rule: `CONTENTPATH` was a new config key, so an
upgraded device looked in a location it had never used and showed an empty
content list. The first design detected the situation and offered to fix it.
The better one made restore read both locations while backup writes only to the
new one (`c3994ef4cb`) — the library migrates itself the next time it is backed
up, and there is nothing to explain, prompt about, or document. The prompt-based
version was most of a day's work that turned out to be unnecessary.

Applies past config keys: file formats, marker names, menu locations, directory
layouts. If a device that upgrades and a device that is freshly flashed can both
be made to just work, that is the answer, and everything else is a fallback.

## Current cloud setup policy

D-CLOUD-175 (#508) retires automatic cloud-folder migration for 0.0.1.
Normal backend linking creates the selected folders and README files; fresh
configurations default to `/pixelelated`. Existing credentials and configured
paths stay unchanged until an explicit folder selection. Scans do not join,
follow or move an older cloud library, and content discovery never silently
replaces the selected path. Users populate or rearrange cloud files themselves.
This does not remove ordinary sync, selective restore or OS upgrade testing.
The retired migration's history and proofs remain historical evidence. The
general safeguards below apply if a future migration is actually required.

## Migrations

If a migration is genuinely needed:

- **Non-destructive first.** Copy and verify before removing anything. A
  migration killed halfway must leave the device working, not stranded between
  two layouts.
- **Attribute honestly.** Do not stamp existing data with metadata you have not
  verified — inventing authoritative-looking wrong data is worse than leaving it
  unknown. `unknown` must be a value the consumer handles.
- **Idempotent.** It will run twice. That must be harmless.
- **Prefer additive.** Writing new data in the new shape while still reading the
  old shape avoids a migration entirely, and cannot be interrupted destructively.

### Migrating data that lives in someone's cloud

The rules above still apply; these are the ways a remote migration is harder
than a local one, and each has cost somebody their data somewhere.

- **Copy, verify, then delete — never `rclone move`.** `move` deletes as it
  goes, so an interruption leaves the library split across two locations with
  no record of which files went where. Copy the whole set, verify it, and only
  then remove the original.
- **Verify means comparing content, not trusting an exit code.** `rclone check`
  compares hashes; a zero exit from the transfer itself only says the command
  ended. A partial batch can exit clean.
- **Interruption is the normal case, not the exception.** A handheld drops off
  wifi mid-transfer as a matter of course, where a local migration is only
  interrupted by power loss. Design for resumption, and make a second run
  harmless.
- **Never move what you did not put there.** `/storage/roms` belongs to us; a
  cloud folder is shared with the owner's own files. Act only on paths the
  device can account for — `cloud_setup --content-location` reports the
  directories this device actually has locally, and deliberately ignores the
  rest. A migration that swept up somebody's photos because they sat in the
  same folder would be unforgivable and entirely avoidable.
- **Ask first, and let "leave it alone" be the default.** Cloud layout is
  usually cosmetic; the risk of moving is not. If the tidier layout cannot
  justify the failure mode, offer the no-op resolution and stop there.
- **The model is one player, one console at a time (D-CLOUD-102, D-CLOUD-103):**
  no other device writes the same cloud folder while a migration runs, and no
  lock or marker tries to stop one. What a migration cannot assume is that the
  *previous* run finished -- interruption is the normal case above -- so it
  reads the cloud's state before every step rather than remembering it.
  (This bullet said "another device may be syncing at the same time" until
  2026-09-28; it predated D-CLOUD-102 and contradicted it -- stream A, #307.)

## Verify on a device, not on the host

**And on the VM before the device** (`engineering-practices.md` § "If the VM
can test it, the VM tests it first"). The VM is a device for this purpose — the
same busybox, scripts and binary — and it is the one you can afford to break.

Host tools are not the tools on the device, and the difference hides real
failures. Info-ZIP on a desktop silently replaces a symlink and returns success;
busybox on the device refuses and aborts. The bug was invisible until it ran on
the target.

The cheap way to cover both paths, per
[`generic-x64-vm-testing`](generic-x64-vm-testing.md):

- **Clean install** — boot the built image in a fresh VM.
- **Upgrade** — boot a VM from the *previous* image, use it enough to create
  state (a backup, a config change, a save), then update it in place and confirm
  that state still works.

`tools/vm-upgrade-rehearsal <previous img.gz> <new tar> <new BUILD_ID>` runs the
upgrade half end to end and fails closed on any piece of state that did not
survive (first run 2026-09-20, build 15 to `77e7e97515`, 20 of 20). The clean
install is what `tools/vm-qa` boots from the image every run.

**And under the device's tools, not the host's.** `tr -d '[:print:][:space:]'`
deletes every printable byte under GNU tr and eight literal characters under
busybox tr, so a text check that passed in `tools/last-good-scripts-test`
rejected every real `system.cfg` on every device and the last-good record
was never written (2026-09-10, blindspot 34). The test now runs every
command that is a busybox applet on the device (`sed mv cp tr head wc cut
awk`) through the image's busybox from the build root, and its fixtures are
the image's own files, not three lines typed for the test. When a script
will run under busybox, ask of every external command it calls whether the
host's is the same program -- `readlink -f $(command -v tr)` on the device
answers it -- and shim the ones that are not, not only the ones already known
to differ.
