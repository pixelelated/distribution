# Engineering practices

High-signal, generalizable practices. Add entries only when a learning clearly generalizes
beyond one task (see `learning-capture.md`).

## Change stays inside the fork's lanes

Maintainer, 2026-09-22, when a rule made for the fork's pages (D-UI-078)
would have reached four upstream surfaces: *"We don't need to alter
behaviors outside of the core work we've been tackling [...] I'm more
comfortable modifying work within the different lanes we've been working
in around cloud sync, cloud behaviors, game saves, Wi-Fi, etc."*
(D-UI-079). The lanes are the fork's own work: cloud sync and cloud
behaviours, game saves and save states, Wi-Fi and the network pages, the
offline achievements work, and the pages those touch. A practice that
generalises is recorded as a rule and applied inside the lanes; an
upstream surface outside them -- a card, a menu, a flow the fork has not
been working in -- is left as upstream has it until the maintainer opens
that lane, however well the rule would fit. Name the surfaces the rule
would also reach and ask; do not fold them into the change.

## Verify design intent before "fixing" an apparent bug

Before changing code that looks wrong, confirm it isn't intentional:

- **Read the history.** `git log -S<symbol>` / `git log -p -- <file>` and the original commit
  often reveal intent (or that a variable is dead/leftover).
- **Check the guards around it.** A dangerous-looking call may be gated by a default, a mode,
  or a filter that makes it safe in practice.
- **Map the full blast radius.** Understand what a flag/filter actually affects before assuming
  impact (e.g. allowlist vs denylist semantics).
- **Prefer a question over a silent rewrite** when intent is ambiguous — confirm with the
  maintainer rather than changing deliberate behavior.
- **Read the log before changing options, not only before fixing bugs.** A
  flag that looks like a tidy-up may be the residue of a failed attempt.
  `git log --oneline -- <recipe>` on 2026-09-20 would have shown "keep VIDEO
  on -- disabling it is not a configuration the GTK port builds" from three
  weeks earlier; four builds rediscovered it instead (blindspot 48).
- **A constraint lives beside the thing it constrains.** When the history
  does hold the reason, write it into the recipe or config next to the
  option, with the date and commit. A commit message is where the lesson
  was found, not where it should stay.

**Case study:** restore-side `--delete-excluded` in the rclone cloud-sync scripts looked like
data loss, but was gated by the default `RESTOREMETHOD=copy` (delete is a no-op for `copy`),
and `RESTORE_RCLONEOPTS` turned out to be dead code. Checking the original ROCKNIX commit
settled intent, and the maintainer's input reframed it from "bug" to a design question — a
silent "fix" would have changed intended behavior.

## Verify the artifact, not the report

Check what was *produced* — the file written, the bytes transferred, the
process still running — not what the software *said about itself*. Software
reports success from inside its own assumptions; the artifact does not.

Three cases from this project, all of which reported success:

- `cloud_restore` filtered on `backup/*.zip` when the archive sits at the
  transfer root. It matched nothing, transferred nothing, exited 0 and
  printed SUCCESS. It shipped in four images that way.
- A provider form discarded the vendor the player chose, because the value
  was written by a `save()` that runs at page close while the action read it
  earlier. It reported "configured and working" — truthfully, since WebDAV
  tolerates an empty vendor. Only `cat rclone.conf` showed the choice gone.
  On Sharepoint that is the wrong protocol dialect.
- A backup "succeeded" for months on devices with no `zip` binary in the
  image, because the restore path uses busybox `unzip`, which was present.

The corollary for UIs: **an action that returns you to a previous screen has
not necessarily mis-fired — the process may have died.** EmulationStation
abort()ed on an assert, its supervisor restarted it, and the display fell
back to the game carousel. That is indistinguishable from a mis-aimed
keypress. Three attempts and a rewrite of the input handling went by before
anyone ran `ps`; `journalctl` had `status=134/n/a` (SIGABRT) the whole time.
When a UI step does not do what you expect, confirm the process is still
alive before re-driving the input.

An end-to-end test that passes tells you the pipeline ran. It does not tell
you the pipeline was correct.

## A failure you find is yours to fix

Finding a defect creates an obligation to deal with it, not merely to record
it. Filing an issue is how the work is tracked; it is not how the work is
discharged. "Not caused by this change" and "was already broken" describe
provenance, not priority — the failure is now known, and shipping past a known
failure is a decision someone has to make deliberately rather than by default.

Two habits follow.

**Fix it in the session that found it, or say plainly that you did not.** A
finding buried in a comment while the work moves on is indistinguishable, later,
from a finding nobody had. If it genuinely must wait — the fix needs a design
decision, or it is far outside the current scope — put the reason in the issue
and name it in the handover, so the choice to defer is visible and someone
else's to overturn.

**Then close the hole that let it through.** Every real defect is also a
statement about the tests: something passed that should not have. Add the case
before moving on, and make it fail against the unfixed code if you still can.

`cloud_backup` reported a successful upload while sending nothing, because the
remote offered neither modtimes nor hashes and rclone compared by size (#53).
`tools/cloud-round-trip` already exercised that phase — it wrote an archive,
backed it up, restored it, and compared hashes — and it passed throughout,
because it reset the remote first. Every upload it tested was a first upload,
and a first upload always transfers. The gap was not the assertion but the
scenario: a comparison that wrongly concludes "already there" needs something
to already be there. The regression case is a second backup, of an archive
changed but the same size.

Assertions that only hold because nothing had happened yet are the ones to
distrust — see also *Verify the artifact, not the report*.

## A name is not a behaviour, and a summary is not the source

*Verify the artifact, not the report* covers software that reports success.
This is its quieter sibling: **nobody reported anything, and a claim was made
anyway** — read off a function's name, a log line's wording, a comment, or a
document's summary, and then stated as fact about what the code does.

Four in one day, 2026-09-18/19, all in the same subsystem:

- **`refresh_game_patch`** re-reads the achievement set. The player's unlocks
  are `cache_unlocks`, a separate call. A helper built on the first alone
  answered `re-read 1 game(s), 0 failed` while changing nothing that mattered
  — and the commit message for it claimed the function "re-fetches the patch
  and the player's unlocks", which was read from the name. Caught only
  because the maintainer reset two achievements on the site and the device
  still read them as earned.
- **A log line's wording taken as scope.** `Periodic refresh: N game(s) due
  (patch older than 86400s)` is the *selection predicate*; the pass then
  re-reads patch **and** unlocks. The maintainer was told the opposite. The
  patch file's first sentence said so plainly.
- **A summary table taken as the record.** An issue's table listed two
  crashes and said "both entries are Bubble Bobble". Two more, including the
  only one with a core dump, were in its comments. A whole line of reasoning
  was built on the table.
- **A comparison that could not fail.** Two package pins compared as empty
  strings, printing "SAME" — the `guards must fail closed` rule, committed
  while writing about it.

The common shape: a **claim by an author** — a name, a comment, a log string,
a table — was treated as an **observation**. Authors describe intent; only
the artifact records behaviour.

So, before stating what code does:

- **Name the artifact that would settle it, and read that.** For "does this
  refresh the unlocks?", the artifact is the row's `cachedAt` moving, not the
  function's name. For "what does this pass cover?", it is the code or the
  patch that wrote it, not the line it prints. For "what happened?", it is the
  log and the comments, not the summary someone wrote over them.
- **When a name and a behaviour disagree, the name is wrong** and is worth
  fixing or commenting — but the claim you make is the behaviour's.
- **A document's summary is a pointer to its evidence**, and the evidence is
  usually somewhere the summary does not go: an issue's comments, a patch's
  prose, a second table. Read to the bottom before repeating the top.
- **Say which one you did.** "The row's timestamp moved" and "the function is
  called refresh" are different sentences, and only one of them is evidence.


## A promise is not a mechanism: report the running state, not the intention

*A name is not a behaviour* covers claims about code. This is the same rule
turned on **your own next actions**, and it was missing: "I'll watch this" is a
claim about behaviour with no artifact behind it, and it is worth less than
nothing, because the person reading it stops watching too.

Maintainer, 2026-09-19: *"The promise to do something is less valuable than
the proof that something is about to be done... focus on the active state of
doing something as opposed to a guarantee of a future state."*

The case: a cold build was started and reported with "I'll report when it lands
or breaks." It broke **seven hours** before anyone noticed, because nothing was
watching. The next run was reported with "this time it's watched." Nothing was
watching then either; it broke and sat **five hours**. The third run differed
in exactly one way — a process existed.

### The form

For anything short-term and operational — a build, a transfer, a device coming
back, a job that must be checked later — one of two sentences is allowed:

- **"It is running, and here is what is watching it."** Name the artifact: the
  PID, the file it blocks on, the timer, the hook. A reader can check it.
- **"I have not set anything up to watch this."** Also fine. It tells the
  reader the job is theirs.

What is not allowed is the future tense standing alone. "I'll keep an eye on
it", "I'll report back", "this time it's watched" — none of those is a
mechanism, and the last one was false when written.

### Recorded is not delivered: arm both, every time

The first time this rule was applied it was applied by half. `tools/watch-job`
was written so a long job leaves a **durable** record — a status file that
survives a reaped task and whose staleness is visible. It does exactly that.
It delivers nothing: it writes a file, and a file tells no one. The H700 build
that followed was armed with the file alone and reported as "the watcher will
tell me when it lands or dies" — which was false in the tense it was written.
It failed at 21:20; the file said so from 21:21; nobody read it until 22:42.

Two mechanisms, because they fail differently:

- **The record** — `watch-job --detach`. Survives the session, survives the
  harness reaping its own tasks, and reports `died` rather than silence when
  the job is killed. Cannot notify.
- **The delivery** — a harness background waiter (`until [ -f <rc> ]; do
  sleep 60; done` under `run_in_background`). Notifies the session the moment
  the job ends. Can be reaped under memory pressure, and then says nothing.

Neither alone is a watch. The sentence that satisfies this rule names
**both**: *"watch-job is recording to `<status>` (pid N), and a harness
waiter on `<rc>` will deliver the result."* If the waiter has been reaped and
not re-armed, say so, and read the file by hand at a stated interval.

**Completion must reach the maintainer (D-WORKFLOW-143, #395).** Before the
next long build or QA job, name and verify its result-delivery path. During
an active session, await the job or check its status at most 60 seconds
apart, and announce success, failure or death as soon as observed, before
unrelated work. Do not end the turn with only a detached recorder and imply
an alert will arrive. Delivery across a disconnected session needs a named,
tested destination; a log, callback submission or GitHub update alone does
not prove receipt. Until that path is configured, call the run actively
supervised and state that it cannot alert after disconnection. A missing
delivery path stays an open issue, even if every recorder control passes.

Two more traps met arming it, both already in this project's records:
`pgrep -f` on the job's name matched the session's own shell (blindspot: the
self-matching pattern — anchor it: `^/bin/bash \./build-h700\.sh$`), and
`pkill -f` on the watcher's command line killed the shell issuing it. Stop a
watcher by the pid its status file records, never by pattern.

### Say how the watch fails

For buffered parallel builds, pass `--activity-dir <frozen-build-root>/.threads/logs`
to `tools/watch-job` (D-WORKFLOW-141, #393). The main log advances when a
package completes, while a long compilation writes only its package log.
The status keeps overall progress separate from the freshest package's
progress, names the observed file, and ignores non-log heartbeat files.
Build monitoring uses `watch-job --build-progress` (selected by `watch-build`
outside QA mode): only structured pkgbuilder DONE/FAIL lines count as overall
progress. A package's Ninja counters can also appear in the aggregate log;
their shape alone does not identify the overall total (#412).
Current progress/routing controls are `test-progress.py` and
`test-watch-build.py` under `docs/qa-logs/2026-10-04-watch-progress/`.
The latter resolves the image from the current Makefile; the historical
routing fixture retains the old namespace and its old evidence (#413).
Use only that job's log directory; another job's writes cannot prove this
one is moving. `stalled` means no watched log writes, a **suspected** stall;
a quiet linker can still be busy. Inspect its process before acting.

Run a retained copy of the watcher for long jobs, keep its status PID file,
and replace it by that exact PID after testing the new copy. Never edit an
executing shell script. `docs/qa-logs/2026-10-03-watch-job/test-watch-job.py`
checks buffered output, real inactivity, heartbeat, completion, death,
invalid observations and detached startup. This improves the record; it
does not provide the separate notification channel described above. When
the current harness has no background result-delivery facility, explicitly
say notification is unarmed; do not promise an automatic message.

A monitor is a guard, so *guards must fail closed* applies to it. State the
condition under which it stays silent while the thing it watches is dead:

> The watcher fires when the build writes its exit code. If the script is
> killed outright — OOM, a reboot — no exit code is written and the watcher
> waits forever, which looks exactly like a healthy build.

A watch whose silent-failure mode has not been named has not been thought
through.

### Why this one has no tool behind it

Every other rule here can be checked by something: `pkgcheck`, `register-check`,
`es-menu-map-check`, the pre-push guard. This one cannot — no tool can read a
sentence and tell whether the process it describes exists. So it is enforced by
the shape of the sentence itself: **if you cannot name the running artifact,
you may not make the claim.** That is the self-examining tier in
`working-principles.md`'s enforcement ladder, and it is where a rule lands when
nothing better is available. Naming that openly is better than implying an
enforcement that is not there.


## Guards must fail closed

A check that cannot run has not passed. Three defects in one day's work shared
this shape, and all three were invisible because the failure mode was silence.
A fourth, later, had the same shape and the opposite outcome:

- A pipeline's status is its **last** command's. `if ! producer | consumer`
  tests the consumer, so a producer that exits 1 — an unreadable input, a full
  disk — is discarded and the guard never fires. `backuptool` wrote short
  archives and announced them as successes.
- An **unquoted** list expanded into a command's arguments. A member name with
  a space split into two names that did not exist, the tool errored into
  `2>/dev/null`, and those members went unscanned — a *credential* scan
  quietly checking less than it claimed.
- **`ls A B` exits non-zero when either glob is unmatched.** Gating on it meant
  that once only one archive format was present — the normal state after a
  format change — the whole verification block was skipped, disabling the guard
  added for a shipped data-loss bug.
- **A check that reads a fixed position in another tool's output.** Verifying
  a Dropbox merge with `rclone check ... | tail -1 | grep -q "0 differences
  found"` looked exact, and matched nothing: rclone prints `N matching files`
  last, and the differences line second to last. This one happened to fail in
  the safe direction — it kept every directory it could not confirm, so the
  cost was a re-run rather than 489 MiB — and that is the whole argument for
  the rule. Grep the output, not a line of it, and let the safe branch be the
  one a broken check falls into.

Each reads as a reasonable check. Each defaults to "proceed" when its own
machinery breaks, which in a subsystem whose signature failure is *reporting
success while doing nothing* is precisely backwards. (The fourth defaulted to
"stop", which is what the rule asks for and why it cost nothing.)

So:

- **Prefer a positive assertion over the absence of an error.** Collect what
  exists and check the count, rather than branching on a command's exit status
  that also means "one of your arguments was empty".
- **`set -o pipefail`** (a subshell keeps it local) wherever a pipeline's first
  stage can fail.
- **Quote every expansion** that becomes another command's arguments, or pass
  the list some other way.
- **`ssh -n` inside a `while read` loop** (or redirect `< /dev/null`). ssh
  reads the loop's stdin, so the loop processes one item and exits having
  reported success; the count is the only thing that shows it. The same is
  true of any command in the loop body that reads stdin.
- **Prove the guard fires.** Construct the violation it exists to catch and
  watch it fail, then fix it and watch it pass. A guard with no observed
  positive is a guard with no evidence — the same rule blindspot 14 states for
  hooks, applied to checks inside a script.

An assertion that cannot fail is not evidence. Ask what input would produce a
FAIL; if you cannot name one, the check proves nothing.

**A fixture for a secret scanner is built at run time, never written as a
literal (2026-09-28, #307).** `tools/last-good-scripts-test`'s cases for the
credential scan and the redaction feed values that look like a private key,
an OAuth token and a `devpassword=`; three were committed as literals by a
fix stream, the push guard read them in history, and the unpushed range had
to be rewritten by the maintainer before `next` could move. So a fixture is
assembled when the case runs -- `printf '%s' 'OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY'` into a
format string, a value passed through `$(printf ...)` -- and the file at rest
carries no line the guard would match. `.githooks/pre-commit` (both
repositories) now refuses such a line at commit time with the same patterns
the push guard uses (`.githooks/secret-patterns`, one definition); a
refusal there costs one edit, at push time it costs a rewrite.

**The positive is recorded where the guard is wired (audit #258, P-02).** A
hook line, a CI step, a suite line or a `check` in a script is committed
with a work-log line naming the constructed failure it was seen to catch,
the date, and the command -- five guards in the RC round had none (the
build's `--wrap-mode=nodownload`, the push guard's index warning, a red
`fork-checks.yml` run, `tools/retroarch-wrapper-test`, `tools/archaeology`'s
own constructed case), and each was proven in an afternoon once asked. A
guard whose positive nobody can point at is a guard whose first real firing
will be argued with. No tool audits this yet: `tools/ceremony-check` proves
blindspot entries name a guard that exists, not that the guard has fired;
extending it to the fork tools is #254's, and until then this paragraph is
the whole enforcement.

**Success reported over a no-op is the same defect with a friendlier face
(audit #258, P-04).** Four shapes from one round, each green:

- **A count echoed is not a floor.** `echo "USING: $(wc -l < table) games"`
  printed `0 games` and the build went on; assert the number, and fail under
  the floor.
- **An exit code named must be defined.** `exit ${EX_USAGE}` with no
  `EX_USAGE=` anywhere is `exit`, the last command's status -- the usage
  `echo`'s 0. `set -u` does not catch it in a script that never enables it.
  Define the constants in one block at the top and grep `exit \$\{` against
  it.
- **A success log line is written from the artifact, not the exit status.**
  `save state copy recorded` on rc 0 recorded nothing when the script had
  exited 0 with a WARN; the script now exits a distinct code and the caller
  says "recorded nothing".
- **A lint reads every copy of the claim it checks.** `lint-audit-artifacts`
  read the Phase 7 table and never the YAML index beside it, which said
  `open` for 32 resolved items; it compares them now.

**And a suite is not wired in until it has been seen to FAIL once, on the
runner's own guest.** "Prove the guard fires" applies to a whole check as
much as to a branch inside one. The time-to-play cell (#135) was written and
measured on a guest whose RetroArch had been set to GL by hand months
earlier; its first dispatch by `tools/vm-qa` on a guest running the image's
default Vulkan driver -- which a QEMU guest cannot draw with -- printed
`time-to-play: PASS in 581s` over a table in which every headline number was
`-`. The tool judged its run by whether it *ran*, not by whether it
*measured*. Three rules came out of it, and they generalise past that suite
(blindspot 39, D-QA-022):

- **A tool that reports numbers fails when the numbers are missing**, and
  says which (`headline_missing()` in `tools/time-to-play`; the report ends
  "Not a pass").
- **A tool that needs the guest in a state the image does not ship puts it
  there for the run and restores it** (`--vm`), rather than depending on a
  condition that happened to be true where it was written.
- **The first PASS of anything new is the one to distrust.** Construct the
  failure, watch the runner report it, then trust the green.

A fifth, of the same family (2026-09-10): the picker's scan named the one
failure it anticipated -- the network gone, exit 69 -- and let every other
failed listing fall through to the success path, so a cloud that refused the
connection was presented as an empty one. A branch for the failure you
expect is not a guard; the guard is that the success path is reached only by
success (`rc -eq 0`, or the one other code that genuinely means "nothing
there"), and every other value is a failure whether or not you have a name
for it.

Two more shapes, the fourth and fifth instances of blindspot 22 (a probe
that cannot report absence), promoted here on 2026-09-06:

- **A missing tool is a failing guard.** `comm … | wc -l` on the image's
  busybox — which has no `comm` — read 0, and 0 meant "nothing differs".
  A count built on a command that may not exist must fail loudly when it
  does not (`command -v` first), and any script that reaches for a
  coreutils name runs on the VM before the host's answer is believed
  (`generic-x64-vm-testing.md` § What the guest's busybox lacks).
- **A kill by pattern reaches the shell that runs it.** `pkill -f
  'vm76[.]qcow2'` killed its own shell because the same command text held
  the literal in an `rm` three lines down, and `bash -c` carries the whole
  script in its argv. Long-lived processes get a pidfile; a kill goes by
  PID; when a pattern is unavoidable, filter the hits by
  `/proc/<pid>/comm` before signalling.

## Before deleting a duplicate, diff its behaviours, not its purpose

"These two do the same job" is a claim about purpose. Deletion acts on
behaviour, and the two are rarely identical. Blindspot 23 was committed three
times in one day, which is the rule-of-three threshold for turning a retro note
into a rule:

- The GAME SETTINGS save rows were removed as duplicates of the transfer flow.
  They carried per-operation last-run stamps the flow never shows for saves
  alone.
- The NETWORK SETTINGS cloud group went with them, and `CHANGE CLOUD FOLDER`
  was reproduced nowhere.
- The game-end OS hook was replaced by an in-ES call so the sync would be
  visible. The hook's `pgrep` guard against a concurrent sync was not carried
  across, and a sync at boot plus a game exit put two rclone writers on one
  remote.

Each survivor genuinely could do the job. Each casualty had a property only it
had — state it reported, a row only it offered, a guard only it held.

So, before removing anything as redundant, write down what the *doomed* copy
does that the *survivor* does not: every side effect, guard, stamp, setting it
reads, and place it is reachable from. If the list is empty, say so
explicitly. If it is not, each item is either re-homed on the survivor or
deliberately dropped with the reason recorded. The survivor's ability to
perform the operation is never the test; the test is whether anything the
casualty *protected* or *reported* still is.

## Stop after three fixes on the same failure

Three sequential fix-commits on one failure without resolving it means stop:
re-read the source from the top and question the model, because you are
probably fixing the wrong layer. Each successive patch feels like progress and
narrows attention onto the last symptom, which is exactly when the actual cause
stops being examined.

2026-08-29, in one stretch: a chosen list value never reached the config; the
fix for that called `getSelected()` when nothing was selected and abort()ed
EmulationStation; the fix for *that* read `BACKUPFILE`, which belongs to
`backuptool` and is unset in `cloud_backup`; and its replacement read
`OS_NAME`, which is also empty there. Two of the four were the same mistake —
assuming a variable existed — and thirty seconds reading the top of the script
would have shown both. The third patch was the signal to go and read.

Afterwards, ask where it could have been caught earlier and add that guard.
`tools/cloud-round-trip` covered the failing phase and passed anyway, because
it reset the remote first and only ever tested a first upload. Eliminating the
category is part of the fix, not follow-up work.

(Adapted from `incident-response.instructions.md` in an external instruction estate.)

## Never reboot, update, or power-cycle a device without asking

Maintainer, 2026-09-06, after a session pushed an image and rebooted a handheld
while a restore was running on it: *"you just rebooted my device without
asking. We need a rule that says that you should never reboot my device without
asking."* Binding, with no standing authorisation: permission to build, to push
a file, or to "get the new build onto the devices" is not permission to reboot.
Each reboot is asked for, at the moment it would happen, naming the device.

- **A device belongs to a person, and that person may be using it.** An idle
  check is a prerequisite to asking, not a substitute for it. It was a
  prerequisite that failed here: it looked for a running emulator and nothing
  else, and a cloud restore was running.
- **The idle check covers everything that would be interrupted**: an emulator,
  a cloud transfer (`rclone`, `cloud_backup`, `cloud_restore`,
  `cloud_content_*`, the lock at `/var/run/cloud_sync.lock` — **an `flock`, so
  test it with `flock -n /var/run/cloud_sync.lock true`; the file's existence
  means nothing, it stays behind after every run** — the transfer page in
  EmulationStation), a scrape, an update already staged. Use a pattern
  the checking shell cannot match itself: `rclon[e]`, never a zero-width tail
  like `cloud_content_[a-z]*`, which matches its own literal in the shell's
  argv and reported two phantom transfers on 2026-09-06. When a count is not
  zero, list the processes before believing it.
- **Ask before the transfer too, not only the reboot** (maintainer,
  2026-09-07, D-QA-011: *"Why wouldn't you just ask me if it's okay to
  transfer? I thought that was our policy. It's fine if you're waiting for it
  to be idle, but you might as well just ask."*). Copying the update tarball
  into `~/.update` changes nothing until the next boot, but it is a gigabyte
  over the device's Wi-Fi and a write to somebody's card, so it is a
  question — one that can be answered once for a batch ("stage on both when
  idle"), unlike the reboot. Waiting for idle is a courtesy on top of the
  answer, never a substitute for asking. No automatic waiter stages a
  device on its own.
- **A queue of deployments is a queue of questions.** Five images in a night
  do not earn a standing yes; the fifth reboot is asked for like the first.

Recovery from the case that produced this rule: `cloud_restore` and
`cloud_content_restore` are `rclone copy`, which writes each file to a
temporary name and renames on completion and never deletes, so an interrupted
run leaves no partial files and re-running it completes it.

## Nothing runs on a person's device without their yes -- not only the reboot

Maintainer, 2026-09-11, after a session ran the exit test on the RG35XX SP
(seven game launches through RetroArch, each firing the game-exit sync to
their Dropbox) and a Dropbox replacement proof, on the strength of "we can
do some testing of the forms you mentioned on an actual device, as well as
anything else that requires device testing": *"In the future, if you're
going to be testing anything on device as opposed to in the VM, I need to
know what you're doing so I know if it's going to interfere with my
experience. This is similar to how you shouldn't push a build without
asking or restart without asking. You should not be playing or using the
console without asking, and I need to understand why."* Binding.

The reboot rule above generalises to **every action that uses the device
or its cloud**: launching a game, sending input to its pad, opening its
menus, taking a screenshot, writing under `/storage/roms`, running a sync
or upload against the owner's remote, deleting anything in their cloud.
Reading -- `journalctl`, a config line, a stamp, a listing -- needs no
question, and is said in the report.

- **A general offer of device testing is not a standing yes.** "Anything
  that requires device testing" names a category; each test in it is still
  asked for, at the moment it would run, by name: what it does on screen,
  what it writes, what it sends to the cloud, what it leaves behind, and
  why the VM could not answer it.
- **Say what the test will leave, before it runs.** The exit test cleaned
  up its ROM and save on the device and never mentioned that the game-exit
  sync had already sent them to Dropbox, where `copy` never deletes; the
  owner found the files before the session did. A device test's footprint
  includes every automatic behaviour it triggers on a configured device.
- **The owner's cloud is the owner's.** A QA file uploaded to it, a
  `--backup-dir` copy it made, a deletion -- each is a change to their
  data and is asked for like a reboot. The VM's QA endpoint exists so that
  none of this is ever necessary for a proof.
- **Ask in one message, wait for the answer.** Nothing about the pace of a
  pass justifies skipping the question; the maintainer's evening is the
  thing being protected, and the session cannot see it.
- **A read is free, and still goes through the filter.** Reading needs no
  question, but what is read lands in a transcript, and a device's
  `system.cfg`, its `rclone.conf`, `get_setting` output and anything piped
  back over SSH can carry a sign-in. Pipe every such read through

  ```bash
  grep -v -i -E 'key|pass|token|user|psk'
  ```

  The filter is deliberately wider than the word *password*: rclone writes
  `pass =`, `user =`, `token =` and `key =`, and the network writes `psk`. A
  filter written as `password` let a `pass =` line through on a QA guest on
  2026-09-12, which is why the QA guests are in scope too -- their
  credentials are throwaway, their config files are the same shape, and the
  transcript is the same transcript. A line the filter drops is a line
  nobody needed; a line it lets through with a secret in it is a transcript
  to scrub. `docs/device-testing-policy.md` § "Reading a device's output" is
  the long form. (D-QA-021.)

  **Except where the line's presence is the evidence.** A `PASS`/`FAIL`
  verdict, a suite's summary, and an action-log line all match `pass` or
  `user` by accident, and a read that drops them reports an absence that is
  the filter's: on 2026-09-27 the reboot's own `device-act` lines were
  looked for three times and "missing" -- their label quoted the
  maintainer's *"fully tested and passing build"*. For those reads, mask the
  value and keep the line:

  ```bash
  sed -E 's/((token|key|passw[a-z]*|psk|user)[=:])[^ ]*/\1***/Ig'
  ```

  The group closes at the delimiter and the value sits outside it: the
  example carried the value inside group 1 for two weeks (`\1***` printed it
  back, audit of the fix round PL-013), so a masking pattern is proven on a
  fake `key=SECRET` line first, and the proof is the absence of `SECRET` in
  what comes out.

  and keep the dropping `grep -v` for config files and `get_setting` output,
  where the line itself is the secret.

## If the VM can test it, the VM tests it first

Maintainer, 2026-09-06: *"if we can test something on the VM, we should test on
the VM and certainly test it first there."* Binding. The GENERIC_X64 image
(`generic-x64-vm-testing.md`) runs the same busybox, the same scripts, the same
EmulationStation binary and the same QA cloud backends as a handheld, and it
costs nothing to break. A handheld is where a mistake becomes somebody's
evening, and where the only evidence is over a wifi link to a device that may
be in use.

So, before anything touches a device:

- **Ask what the VM cannot prove**, and write the answer down. It cannot prove
  boot-loader selection on a given board, a real panel's rendering, a real
  provider's behaviour, or anything that depends on the device having history
  the VM lacks — and the last of those is answered by booting the VM from the
  *previous* image and creating that history, per `upgrade-and-install.md`.
  Everything else it can prove, and proves first.
- **The VM run is the evidence; the device run is the confirmation.** A device
  check that finds something the VM did not is a gap in the VM fixtures to
  close, not a reason to keep testing on devices.
- **Never stage state on a device the VM could have staged.** Editing a live
  config to provoke a refusal is exactly the kind of test the VM exists for.

The case that produced the rule: the vocabulary sweep (#73) was verified on two
handhelds first — the migration, a refusal path, an archive rename — and every
one of those could have run in the VM, where the same busybox helper, the same
scripts and `tools/cloud-test-backend` were sitting ready. The devices were
faster only because they already carried a previous image's state, which the
VM's upgrade recipe reproduces in minutes.

## An ask to the user is a decision, not an errand

Before handing over a command to run, establish that the session genuinely
cannot do it. A request is appropriate when what is needed is a *decision* —
approval, a credential only they hold, an action on hardware you cannot reach.
It is not appropriate as a way to skip finding the channel.

The tell is when the same problem gets solved without help shortly afterwards.
On 2026-08-28 the user was asked to run `ssh-copy-id` against a handheld; the
identical problem on a VM was solved minutes later by writing
`authorized_keys` over the serial console. The handheld had no serial console,
so the ask was legitimate — but that was never said, and the reasoning was
never done.

So: exhaust what the session can reach first, and when a channel really is
missing, name it. "There is no way to provision a key to a device from a
session without an existing login" is a useful finding; "please run this" is
not. Note also that `!`-prefixed commands run **non-interactively** — anything
needing a password or a prompt has to happen in the user's own terminal, and
that is worth saying rather than letting the command fail in front of them.

(Adapted from `operator-asks.instructions.md` in the same estate.)

## Fail gracefully: do what you can, keep the last good state, say how to recover

Maintainer, 2026-09-10 (D-CLOUD-077): *"I think failure is okay. We just need
to make sure that we degrade gracefully. If something fails, we need to have a
recovery process and a user notification process. It's easy to say, 'We
weren't able to upload. Please try again.'"* Binding for every operation a
player can start or that starts on their behalf.

- **A failure ends, and ends soon.** Bounded timeouts everywhere a network or
  a disk can stall (D-CLOUD-075); a run that cannot finish says so within a
  known time rather than holding a card, a gate, or a screen.
- **The last known good state stays in place.** Prefer operations that are
  atomic per unit (rclone's temp-and-rename, `mv` over a written temp file,
  markers written only after the bytes are confirmed) so an interrupted run
  leaves the previous file, not a partial one, and a re-run completes it.
  Where partial success is possible, it is reported as partial.
- **The message is for the player, not the developer.** What did not happen,
  in their words (`WE COULDN'T FINISH BACKING UP YOUR SAVES. WHAT DID ARRIVE
  IS IN YOUR CLOUD; THE REST IS AS IT WAS.`), then how to recover (`TRY AGAIN
  WHEN YOU'RE BACK ONLINE.`). Never a log path, an exit code, or a `logger`
  hint on a handheld's screen; the log is for us and we read it over SSH.
- **The retry is in reach.** The surface that reported the failure offers it:
  a button on the page, the row on the card's outcome line, a re-run that is
  safe because the state was kept.
- **Silence is the worst failure.** A scan that fails and shows an empty cloud,
  a run that exits 0 after moving nothing, a card that fades with no outcome:
  each is a lie by omission (blindspot 13 and 33 are both this shape).

Audit of the existing surfaces against this: #105.

**The last known good state is a record, kept on purpose (D-CLOUD-078).**
Maintainer, 2026-09-10: *"we should always keep a record of the last known
good state ... if something fails, it should always revert to the last known
good state ... the successful state becomes the last known good state, and we
can remove the previous one."* For every writer that means three things, in
order: know that you succeeded (a positive check of the artifact, not the
absence of an error); replace the old state only after that check
(temp-and-rename, a marker after the bytes, a copy held until the replacement
is verified); then remove the superseded record, once, so exactly one
last-known-good exists at rest. Test it by killing the writer at every step
and asserting the previous state is what remains -- a writer that leaves an
empty file, a half-written one, or two candidates has failed this rule.
`system.cfg` and `es_settings.cfg` failed it on 2026-09-09 (#102): rewritten
in place, backed up every boot with whatever was there, so a truncated file
replaced its own good copy and defaults won.

## A device's state is read from the device, and an act on it is written down as it happens

Maintainer, 2026-09-14, after the harness had denied a reboot the device's own
journal showed it had sent: *"We should think about if there's anything we should
add to an instruction file, etc., to make sure you're keeping track of the truth
behind some of these log-related behavior claims."* Blindspot 42 is the case.

- **Before saying what did or did not happen on a device, read the device.**
  `journalctl -b -1` (this image keeps several boots), the ssh logins in it, the
  unit's log, `last` where it exists, the boot id. A tool result in the transcript
  is one witness and is read with the bias of knowing what the command was meant
  to do; the device's record has no such bias. When the two disagree, the device
  wins and the disagreement itself is reported.
- **Write every state-changing device action down as it happens, not after.**
  `tools/device-act <target> <label> -- <command>` runs the command over ssh and
  appends BEGIN and END lines to `/workspace/artifacts/rocknix-device-actions.log`
  with the device's boot id before and after -- a changed boot id is a reboot,
  whatever anyone remembers. Reboots, updates staged into `/storage/.update`,
  settings written on a device: through it, or with the same two lines written by
  hand. The log lives outside the repo and outside any per-session scratch.
- **Answer "did you do X" with evidence, not memory.** Quote the action log line
  and the device's journal line, or say that neither exists. "I don't think so" is
  not an answer about a device someone else owns.
- **When you were wrong, correct every place the wrong statement landed** -- the
  issue comment, the work log, the reply -- in the same session, and say plainly
  that the earlier statement was wrong.

## Never edit a shell tool while a run of it is in flight

bash reads a script by file offset as it executes, so an edit to
`tools/vm-qa` while a run was inside its walks made that run fail twenty-two
minutes later with `---: command not found` and a syntax error at a line that
reads fine (run 19, 2026-09-23). `bash -n` on the edited file passes, which
makes it look like a harness bug. While a bash tool is running, edit a copy
or queue the change until the run's rc file exists; Python and compiled tools
are safe to edit mid-run, shell scripts are not. If a run dies with a
nonsense syntax error, check the file's mtime against the run's start first.
