name: code-auditor
description: Rigorous multi-pass code auditor that independently verifies spec conformance, acceptance-criteria completion, project-doctrine alignment (instruction files + blindspot register), cross-system interaction safety, and code quality. Runs at Epic and Milestone boundaries; the phase-tier scoped audit (spot checks, ~30 min) lives in the `mini-retro` skill and its findings feed this skill. Use when the user says "audit this work", "audit the milestone", "verify X is done", "is this really complete", "check for gaps", "run a code audit", "produce a punch list", or when a feature/epic/milestone is claimed complete and needs adversarial verification before merge or deploy. Produces dated audit artifacts (running log at milestone tier, research, forward audit, retrospective, analysis, punch list with machine-readable index) plus a GitHub issue with the prioritized punch list.

# Code Auditor

Rigorous, independent, adversarial verification of completed work. **Not** a helpful code reviewer offering feedback — a second engineer independently proving that work was completed correctly, completely, and in conformance with the plan.

**Assume nothing is done until proven done.**

## Execution discipline — SERIAL (hard gate)

This skill is **stage-gated**: every stage consumes the *settled* output of the stage
before it. Run stages **strictly in order, under ONE orchestrator, never in parallel**
— fanning stages out to concurrent agents/sessions voids the guarantees (origin:
2026-07-08, an agent parallelized a code-auditor run). In-stage sub-agents are allowed
only where a stage explicitly says so. Swarm rule: while this skill is active on a
scope, do not mutate that scope from elsewhere - an audit of a moving target
proves nothing about either state.

## Continue through checkpoints (D-WORKFLOW-149)

A saved research or phase checkpoint preserves an authorized audit; it does
not end it. Write the checkpoint, then take the next runnable action in the
same session. Do not ask for renewed permission or end the turn merely because
notes were saved, a phase completed, or the audit needs sustained work. Stop
only on completion, an explicit owner pause, a concrete blocker that prevents
further authorized work, or an actual execution limit; record the exact state
and reason. Continue independent work while a blocked step is investigated.

Keep **one serial orchestrator**. Use a persistent agent/session continuation
only when the harness provides it and the scope permits it; record the live
owner and its next gated action. A checkpoint, spawned research helper, status
file or detached shell is not an audit orchestrator. When no persistent agent
facility is available, continue the primary review in the active session.

Run long executable checks and Facilitator calls with the existing durable
`tools/watch-build-submit` → `tools/watch-build` / `tools/watch-job` framework
and fresh owners, following `engineering-practices.md`. Bind the command to
the frozen inputs, verify the watcher is live, record status/result paths,
and actively consume completion, failure and stall observations. Provider
calls remain through the Facilitator at their prescribed phase; making a call
durable does not authorize concurrent phases or bypass identity checks.
Submission success is not completion. Do not edit an in-flight tool.

Before reporting that work continues in the background, verify the named
process/agent is actually live and state its result-delivery mechanism. A
command watcher does not deliver off-session notifications by itself (#395),
and a live command does not imply the remaining reasoning stages will run.
Report unfinished-but-idle work plainly and resume it under existing permission.

## Review depth and scope

Record both **scope** (Issue/Epic/Milestone below) and **review depth** before
starting. [Review levels](references/review-levels.md) defines local-only,
two-model and extended three-model audits, plus escalation to a separate full
five-seat council for larger release candidates. Version numbers guide the
choice; migration, security and compatibility risk can raise it. The release's
issue records the chosen depth and reason.

The ordinary independent audit has **two model perspectives total**: the primary
auditor and one external reviewer from a different model lab. Codex/OpenAI-led
work uses the pinned Anthropic reviewer; Anthropic-led work uses the pinned
OpenAI reviewer. Shared OpenRouter/Facilitator transport does not make it a
council run. A Milestone's blind and refutation passes are two calls to the same
reviewer, not additional seats. See Phase 4.6 for selection and evidence.

## Scope tiers

This skill operates at two of the three retro+audit tiers. The third
(Phase-tier) lives in the `mini-retro` skill as a lightweight
scoped-audit step and feeds upward into this skill.

| Tier          | Audit surface                                 | Skill                            | Artifact                                |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Phase**     | 5 spot checks inline in each phase retro      | `mini-retro` (Step 2.5)          | Retro comment § "Scoped audit findings" |
| **Epic**      | Full 6-phase methodology over Epic scope      | **this skill** (Epic scope)      | `docs/audits/YYYY_MM_DD-epic-*/`        |
| **Milestone** | Full 6-phase methodology over Milestone scope | **this skill** (Milestone scope) | `docs/audits/YYYY_MM_DD-milestone-*/`   |

**Choosing a tier.** The surface being audited decides it, not the size of the
diff:

| Scope being audited | Tier |
| --- | --- |
| One issue or one PR | **Issue** — and skip Instruction-Recommendations mode; the 3+ instances rule cannot be evaluated at that scope |
| One epic, or an issue chain inside one epic | **Epic** |
| **Two or more epics, or any scope crossing an epic boundary** | **Milestone** — the running log becomes mandatory |

The last row is the one that gets mis-called. A scope spanning two epics is a
milestone-tier audit even when neither epic is finished and even when the diff
is small, because the value at that tier comes from the seam *between* the
epics — interaction defects, drift, and gaps that no single-epic audit is
positioned to see. (2026-08-24: the cloud-saves ↔ conflict-resolution audit was
called milestone tier on exactly this basis, and its two highest findings were
both seam findings — a script/UI pair that disagreed, and decisions recorded in
one epic while the other's criteria still contradicted them.)

**Tier posture differs by scope.** Epic and Milestone tiers consume
lower-tier findings differently — and the difference is intentional:

| Tier          | Posture toward prior audits                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Epic**      | **Consolidating, with a spot re-verification quota.** Reads every phase retro's scoped-audit section as a primary input and builds on those findings; adds Epic-level cross-cutting analysis (interaction defects between phases, four-surface parity, missing artifacts, spec drift across the Epic). Before consolidating, re-derive at least 2 randomly-chosen consolidated PASS findings from primary sources; if either disagrees with the retro, the trust posture is void for that retro and its findings are fully re-derived. | An Epic is small enough that re-deriving every phase finding is wasteful — but un-sampled trust is how tracker-state evidence creeps in. The quota verifies the feed without redoing it.                                                                                                                        |
| **Milestone** | **Primarily independent re-audit, prior audits as ONE input.** Re-derives findings from spec + code + git history with the full milestone in view. Reads prior Epic audits and phase retros to (a) verify their findings still hold, (b) catch gaps they missed, (c) surface cross-Epic patterns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | A Milestone is large enough that the end-to-end view sees things no per-phase audit could (cross-Epic interaction defects, drift between Epics, capability gaps, accumulated tech debt). The lower-tier audits are valuable corroboration but not substitutes for fresh adversarial verification at full scope. |

**Milestone-tier independence rules:**

- Phase 2 (Forward audit) re-evaluates every spec acceptance criterion
  from primary sources (spec text + code + tests). It does **not**
  copy verdicts from prior audits — and to make that real rather than
  aspirational, prior per-AC verdicts are **sequestered**: Phase 1.5
  builds a provenance/coverage map WITHOUT transcribing PASS/FAIL
  verdicts, and prior verdicts are opened only in Phase 2.5, AFTER
  the independent verdict for that criterion is already written to
  `02-forward-audit.md` (the document-as-you-go cadence makes the
  ordering auditable). If they disagree, document both verdicts and
  reason about why (the prior audit may have been wrong, or the code
  may have regressed since) — disagreement is a finding, not an
  error. Where feasible, run Milestone audits in a fresh session that
  did not implement the work being audited.
- Phase 3 (Retrospective) explicitly looks for **cross-Epic
  interaction defects, drift, and capability gaps** that no
  single-Epic audit could see. This is the milestone tier's primary
  value-add over consolidation.
- Prior audits feed Phase 1 (Research) — not as gospel, but as a
  **provenance map**: who audited what, what they found, what
  they deferred. Use this to know where extra adversarial scrutiny
  is warranted (e.g., "prior audit returned all-PASS in 30 minutes
  on a 500-line PR — re-verify carefully").
- Prior-audit punch-list items still open at Milestone close-out
  must be tracked and either (a) verified resolved by code, (b)
  carried into the Milestone punch list, or (c) explicitly marked
  deferred-to-next-milestone with rationale.

**Tier B (design-review) findings — only if the repo has a design-review /
visual-QA process.** scaffold has none today, so skip this unless one is
present. Where present: phase retros record Tier B verdicts and any deferred
visual-QA items; both Epic and Milestone audits aggregate them into a single
visual-QA section of `04-analysis.md` and roll remaining blocker/major/deferred
items into `05-punch-list.md`. Do **not** re-run page-scale design reviews from
scratch at either tier — but at Milestone tier, do run fresh reviews for any UI
surface that gained material changes after its phase's retro signed off, AND for
any cross-page flow that wasn't reviewable at phase scope.

This means: Phase-tier scoped audits ARE required inputs (don't redo
them at Epic tier). Epic audits ARE inputs at Milestone tier — but the
Milestone audit has its own primary lens and produces findings the
lower tiers structurally couldn't.

## Evidence floor (all tiers)

Three hard rules apply to every verdict at every tier:

1. **Tracker state is never sole evidence.** Issue state, checked AC
   boxes, and retro summaries may corroborate but can never be the
   ONLY evidence for a PASS — every PASS cites at least one primary
   artifact (file:line, executed command output, or commit diff).
   "The issue is closed" is the banned anti-pattern, not evidence.
2. **Mechanical evidence outranks reading.** Where a check exists, RUN it and
   record the command, exit status and counts in the criterion entry. Reading
   a check's source is insufficient when the check itself can be run. What
   exists in this repo:

   | Check | Covers |
   | --- | --- |
   | `tools/pkgcheck <package>` | `package.mk` conventions — the only lint here; run after every recipe edit |
   | `tools/cloud-round-trip --host …` | cloud sync end to end against a real device image |
   | `tools/cloud-test-backend ls` | what a device *actually* uploaded, read from the endpoint rather than from logs |
   | `tools/vm-visual-qa` | ES screens, driven headlessly |
   | a device build | the real test that a package or image is sound |

3. **Run it on a device, not on the host.** Host tools are not the tools on the
   device, and the gap hides real failures — Info-ZIP silently replaces a
   symlink where busybox refuses and aborts (blindspot 7). A verdict about
   runtime behaviour needs evidence from the target: a VM from
   `generic-x64-vm`, or hardware. Host-side reasoning about a device-side
   behaviour is a **lead, never evidence**.

4. **An assertion that cannot fail is not evidence.** Before recording a PASS,
   ask what result would have produced a FAIL. "The excluded file is absent"
   passes trivially when nothing was uploaded at all; "the marker is gone"
   passes when it was never created. If no failing input exists, the check
   proves nothing and must be strengthened or dropped (blindspots 6, 8).
3. **Subagent output is a LEAD, never EVIDENCE.** Per scaffold's development
   principles ("Verify sub-agent outputs against primary artifacts" — project
   ORC-5): every fact that supports a verdict must be re-read directly from the
   primary artifact before the verdict is written. Fan out subagents for research;
   verify their leads yourself. For platform findings, verification means the
   orchestrator runs the exact-verb, multi-surface probe itself.

## When to use

Trigger on any of:

- "Audit this milestone / epic / issue / feature"
- "Verify X is done" / "Is this really complete?"
- "Check for gaps" / "produce a punch list"
- Before merging a feature branch that implements a product spec
- After a complex multi-session implementation to ensure nothing was lost
- When the user suspects work was claimed as done but wasn't fully completed
- Pre-deploy verification for high-risk changes
- Scope drift detection on an in-flight issue chain
- End of Epic (default — consolidates phase-retro scoped audits and
  adds Epic-level cross-cutting analysis)
- End of Milestone (default — primarily independent re-audit at full
  milestone scope; uses prior audits as one input among many to
  verify and to focus extra scrutiny where prior coverage was thin)

**Not** for per-phase audits — those live in `mini-retro` Step 2.5
(see `mini-retro/references/scoped-audit.md`). If you find yourself
tempted to invoke this skill at every phase boundary, the scoped
audit is what you actually want.

## Critical protocol: document-as-you-go

**NEVER batch analysis without writing findings to disk between each step.**

| Why                                                   | What happens if skipped                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Context windows compact — unwritten findings are gone | Audit restarts from zero on compaction                            |
| Audits must be reproducible                           | No trace of what was examined, when, or why a verdict was reached |
| The notes are the deliverable                         | Opinions without evidence don't satisfy an audit                  |

**The cadence:** `READ source → WRITE finding → REPEAT`. If you read something and don't immediately write your observation, you are violating the protocol.

## Audit lifecycle (phases 0–7)

Execute in order. Phases 0–5 each produce or extend an output file;
phases 6–7 close the loop into the tracker.

| Phase | Name                            | Output                                | Detail                                                     |
| ----- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Setup                           | `00-running-log.md` (milestones only) | Phase 0 below                                              |
| 1     | Research                        | `01-research-notes.md`                | [`references/phases.md` § Phase 1](references/phases.md)   |
| 2     | Forward audit                   | `02-forward-audit.md`                 | [`references/phases.md` § Phase 2](references/phases.md)   |
| 2.5   | Verdict cross-check (Milestone) | appended to `02-forward-audit.md`     | [`references/phases.md` § Phase 2.5](references/phases.md) |
| 3     | Retrospective                   | `03-retrospective.md`                 | [`references/phases.md` § Phase 3](references/phases.md)   |
| 4     | Synthesis                       | `04-analysis.md`                      | [`references/phases.md` § Phase 4](references/phases.md)   |
| 4.5   | Finding verification            | appended to `04-analysis.md`          | [`references/phases.md` § Phase 4.5](references/phases.md) |
| 4.6   | Independent review (selected depth; required for Epic/Milestone) | `04-analysis.md` § Second opinion + `second-opinions/` | [`references/phases.md` § Phase 4.6](references/phases.md) |
| 5     | Punch list                      | `05-punch-list.md` (+ YAML index)     | [`references/phases.md` § Phase 5](references/phases.md)   |
| 6     | Punch-list issue                | GitHub issue (`audit`, `punch-list`)  | Phase 6 below                                              |
| 7     | Resolution gate                 | recorded outcome per item             | Phase 7 below                                              |

**Before Phase 6, RUN `tools/lint-audit-artifacts <folder> --issue <n>`.** It
checks the required files, the mandatory `04-analysis.md` sections, that every
punch item has a Phase 7 outcome, that each outcome cites a commit or an issue
rather than asserting one, and that the audit issue carries one checkbox per
punch item.

This is not optional and not a substitute for judgement — it exists because the
2026-08-24 run verified the contract *manually* and missed two things: an
audit issue created with prose headings and no tickable list, and a punch item
recorded as already-merged when the merge had happened thirteen minutes before
the commit it claimed to contain. Re-running the lint after those were fixed
immediately found three more uncited resolutions. Manual contract checking has
a demonstrated failure rate; this does not.

**Load [`references/phases.md`](references/phases.md) before executing each phase.** It contains the full procedure, criterion-entry format, evidence-source mapping, and checkpoint summaries. The SKILL.md body is the shape; `phases.md` is the spec.

---

## Phase 0 — Setup

**First, verify you are running the current copy of this skill.** Skills load
from the invoking directory, so a run started in a feature worktree gets that
worktree's copy — which, if the branch was cut before the skill was last
edited, is stale. An audit grounded against an outdated rubric produces
confident, wrongly-grounded verdicts.

```bash
diff -q .claude/skills/code-auditor/SKILL.md \
        <(git -C <main-checkout> show next:.claude/skills/code-auditor/SKILL.md)
```

Sync before proceeding if they differ, and log it — this happened on the
2026-08-24 run and would have silently degraded that audit's own grounding.

Then create the dated audit folder before any analysis:

```
docs/audits/YYYY_MM_DD-{scope}-{item-name}/
├── 00-running-log.md           ← milestones only (append-only flight recorder)
├── 01-research-notes.md
├── 02-forward-audit.md
├── 03-retrospective.md
├── 04-analysis.md
└── 05-punch-list.md
```

### Naming convention

- `{scope}` — one of `milestone`, `epic`, `issue`
- `{item-name}` — kebab-case descriptor with ID

| Scope     | Example                                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Milestone | `2026_04_22-milestone-41-design-patterns-adoption` |
| Epic      | `2026_04_22-epic-platform-capability-system`       |
| Issue     | `2026_04_22-issue-1634-troubleshooting-animation`  |

Create `docs/audits/` if missing.

### Milestone audits: running log is mandatory

**When `{scope}` is `milestone`, you MUST also create `00-running-log.md` at the start of Phase 0 and append after every meaningful action.**

Why:

- Milestone audits span multiple epics, many issues, dozens of commits — context compaction is nearly guaranteed
- Phase files (01–05) organise by phase; a single chronological log preserves connective tissue across phases
- If the audit "crashes" (compaction, interrupt), the running log is what gets recovered and resumed

**Running log format** (append-only, newest at bottom):

```markdown
# Milestone Audit Running Log — [Milestone Name]

**Auditor:** Code Auditor skill
**Started:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Scope:** Milestone N — [title], Epic(s) #NNN, Issues #XXX–#YYY
**Spec:** [path(s)]

---

## Log Entries

### [Phase N.M] HH:MM — Short descriptor

[What was read/examined]
[Key finding, with file/line reference]
[Verdict or next step]
```

Entries are short (3–10 lines). Depth goes in the phase files; the log's value is **continuity**. Treat it as a flight recorder.

### Phase file header (apply to every phase file)

```markdown
# [Phase Name] — [Item Being Audited]

**Auditor:** Code Auditor skill
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Subject:** [Issue/Milestone/Spec being audited]
**Spec:** [Path to the driving spec]

| Tool                                       | Guidance                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **GitHub reads** (issues, PRs, milestones) | Prefer the GitHub MCP issue/search tools (names vary by runtime — `mcp__github__*` in Claude Code, `mcp_github_*` in Copilot). Avoid `gh` CLI for list/search — bulk output has destabilised agent runners in this repo. |
| **`gh` CLI for writes**                    | Acceptable for `gh issue create` (body-file), `gh label create`, `gh milestone create` — single-record writes. **Always use `--body-file`**, never heredoc (per repo `agent-terminal-safety` instructions).              |
| **`gh` CLI list/search fallback**          | If MCP is unavailable, bound output: `--limit N --json <fields>` or pipe through `\| head`.                                                                                                                              |
| **Git history**                            | `git log --oneline`, `git diff --stat`, `git show <sha>` — standard. Filter by date, path, author.                                                                                                                       |
| **Terminal operations**                    | Never delegate `git`, `npm`, `gh` to subagents — subagents do not inherit terminal access. Run directly.                                                                                                                 |
| **Subagent tool**                          | Useful for parallel read-only investigation. Not for terminal ops. Subagent output is a LEAD, never EVIDENCE — re-read every verdict-supporting fact from the primary artifact yourself (see Evidence floor rule 3).     |

---

## Verdict vocabulary (used in Phase 2 forward audit)

Every acceptance criterion gets one of:

| Verdict          | Meaning                                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PASS ✓**       | Criterion fully met with evidence                          |
| **PARTIAL ⚠**    | Criterion partially met, gaps identified                   |
| **FAIL ✗**       | Criterion not met                                          |
| **SKIP ○**       | Criterion explicitly deferred or descoped (document where) |
| **UNTESTABLE ?** | Cannot verify (explain why)                                |

Each verdict entry must include: evidence (file:line), notes, and gaps (if PARTIAL or FAIL).

**Before recording a FAIL, ask whether it is *dependent*.** A criterion can
fail only because another finding starved it of its input — a restore test
that fails because the upload it depends on is broken says nothing about the
restore. Dependent failures are **UNTESTABLE ?**, not FAIL, and the blocking
finding is named in the entry. Re-test in isolation where you can: supply the
missing input by hand and re-run.

Recording a dependent failure as FAIL invents a defect that does not exist,
and it hides that the real one is still unmeasured. (2026-08-24: content
restore was reported failing by the suite; isolated by planting fixtures at
the endpoint directly, it passed.)

**One false tick voids the list.** When any item in a ticked acceptance-criteria
list is disproved, the trust posture for its siblings is void — re-derive every
one of them from primary artifacts rather than assuming the rest are sound. The
tick was produced by the same process that produced the false one.

See [`references/templates.md`](references/templates.md) for the full criterion-entry format.

## Project conformance (applied in Phase 3)

This repo has no single conformance rubric file. Its doctrine is distributed
across three sources, and Phase 3 runs each as a face, marking every relevant
row ✓/⚠/✗/·:

1. **Instruction files** — `.claude/rules/*.md`. Each carries
   a `paths:` glob; the ones whose glob matches a changed path are **in scope
   and non-optional**. Read them from `next`, not from the feature worktree —
   a branch cut from an older base silently lacks files added since, so an
   audit run in the worktree can miss the rule it should be checking against.
2. **Blindspot register** — `docs/blindspot-register.md`. Twelve recorded
   failure modes this project has actually committed. Ask of each: *does this
   work repeat it?* This is the highest-yield face, because these are proven
   rather than hypothetical.
3. **Project invariants** — the hard rules stated in the instruction files,
   notably from `rclone-cloud-sync.instructions.md`:
   - **Preserve player progress above all.** Conflict handling must never
     default to recency; a newer file can hold *less* progress.
   - Backups must never contain secrets (wifi keys, passwords, tokens).
   - The sync filter is an **allowlist**; `--delete-excluded` makes a filter
     mistake destructive to cloud data.
   - Every change ships onto devices that already have state — check the
     upgrade path *and* the clean install (`upgrade-and-install.instructions.md`).

Conformance is not a rubber stamp. Each row is individually evaluated for
relevance; where the instruction files and this list disagree, **the instruction
files win** — they are canonical, this is a summary.

---

## Cross-system interaction audit (Phase 3, step 3.5)

**Catches interaction defects** — where two subsystems each work correctly in isolation but fail at their intersection. These are the most dangerous class of bugs because single-subsystem testing cannot find them.

For each subsystem touched:

1. **Identify interacting subsystems** — what shares state, resources, or timing? Consult the repo's shared-state register if one exists (scaffold's canonical conventions live in `.claude/rules/`; there is no separate shared-state register yet).
2. **Check for runtime-state assumptions** — config reloads that destroy in-memory state, container restarts that reset ephemeral data, deploys that run multiple instances simultaneously, background tasks (pollers, crons) that conflict across instances.
3. **Verify intersection testing** — was the combination specifically tested? Not "A works" and "B works", but "A works while B is also happening."
4. **Check knowledge propagation** — did the implementer consult docs in the **interacting** subsystem, not just the one changed?

Common risky pairs are in [`references/phases.md` § Phase 3.5 interaction table](references/phases.md).

---

## Build-vs-adopt verification (Phase 3, step 3.5.5)

Verifies the **adopt / extend / contribute-before-build** discipline (doctrine
§1 platform-first; development-principles "Prefer adopt / extend / contribute
before building"). **Applies only if the repo maintains a build-vs-adopt
register** — scaffold does not yet, so treat this as advisory until one exists.
The phase-tier honor check (`mini-retro` scoped-audit, if present) verifies one
phase; this step adversarially verifies the whole scope — both that the question
was **answered** and that the answer was **honored**. (Numbered 3.5.5 to slot
between the cross-system audit and `references/phases.md` § 3.6 "What's missing?".)

For every spec / Epic in the audit scope that shipped net-new platform
behavior, a new integration/surface, or a new primitive:

1. **Answered?** The spec carries a `## Build-vs-Adopt` section and a
   corresponding row exists in the repo's build-vs-adopt register. A governing
   spec with neither → FAIL finding (punch-list item: backfill the answer).
   Specs predating the register get a PARTIAL with a backfill note, not
   a FAIL.
2. **Honored?** Compare recorded path vs. shipped reality across the
   scope's commits:
   - **Adopt** recorded but bespoke code shipped → FAIL.
   - **Build** recorded without the required adoption survey (named
     standards evaluated + disqualifying gaps) → FAIL.
   - **Extend** recorded but the upstream gap was never filed → PARTIAL.
   - Mid-scope reversal without a new register row → PARTIAL (append
     the row; rows are append-only).
3. **Theatre check.** A scope where every answer is "build" with thin
   rationale is a signal the question is being performed, not asked —
   flag it in the synthesis report even if each row technically passes.

Findings land in the Phase 4 synthesis report and the Phase 5 punch
list like any other conformance finding. Evidence-floor rules apply:
the register row and spec section are read directly, never trusted
from a retro summary.

---

## Output artifacts

### Phase 4 — Synthesis report

`04-analysis.md` is the authoritative audit report. Structure:

1. Executive summary (2–3 paragraphs)
2. Acceptance-criteria scorecard (table with verdicts + pass rate)
3. Code-quality assessment (strengths, concerns, complexity hotspots)
4. Cornerstone conformance (overall + findings)
5. Spec fidelity (aligned vs diverged, impact per divergence)
6. Missing artifacts (tests, docs, schemas, etc.)
7. Risk assessment (severity × impact × mitigation)
8. Coverage boundary (what was examined vs deliberately NOT examined, verification depth per AC, audit dimensions not exercised)
9. Finding verification (Phase 4.5 — refutation results for every Critical/High finding)
9a. Second opinion (Phase 4.6 — the other lab's findings and refutations, each graded against the artifact; the command, the provenance path and the served model; mandatory at Epic and Milestone tiers, fails closed without the seat)
10. Quality self-check (recorded table — one row per mandatory section, present/absent-with-reason; silent section-dropping becomes visible drift)

Full structure in [`references/templates.md`](references/templates.md).

### Phase 5 — Punch list

`05-punch-list.md` is the actionable remediation plan — ordered by priority, each item discrete enough for another engineer or agent to execute.

Each item declares (unified schema — also emitted as the machine-readable
YAML index, see `references/templates.md`):

- **Severity** (Critical / High / Medium / Low) — first-class field on the item
- **Category** (Acceptance Criteria Gap / Cornerstone Violation / Interaction Defect / Spec Drift / Missing Artifact / Code Quality / Test Gap / Documentation Gap / Improvement)
- **Source finding** (reference to AC-NN or Phase 3 finding)
- **Owner area** — the subsystem/team surface the fix belongs to
- **What** — precise description of fix
- **Where** — file paths and line numbers
- **Why** — criterion / principle / risk addressed
- **Evidence** — for Critical/High: a reproduction probe (command + expected vs actual)
- **Acceptance** — how to verify the fix is complete

**Punch-list items are audit-DISCOVERED defects and gaps only.** Work that
already lives in an open tracked issue goes into a separate "Pre-existing
tracked scope" cross-reference section (issue links, no PL numbers) that is
explicitly EXEMPT from the Phase 7 resolution gate — restating open
milestone scope as punch items either inflates the begin-delivery Step 1.6
gate or trains agents to blanket-defer, eroding it.

Category → typical priority mapping is in [`references/templates.md`](references/templates.md).

### Phase 6 — Create GitHub punch-list issue (mandatory)

After presenting the punch list to the user, create a GitHub issue with the executive summary, acceptance-criteria scorecard, and full prioritised punch list as a task checklist. This tracker issue is mandatory even when the punch list has zero open items; in that case, create the issue with the resolved/withdrawn/deferred outcomes recorded and close it as completed.

Issue shape:

- Title: `Audit: [Item Name] — [N] findings ([X] critical, [Y] high)`
- Labels: `audit`, `punch-list`, plus relevant epic labels
- Body from `05-punch-list.md` plus the executive summary and acceptance-criteria scorecard. Write the body to a file and pass it via `--body-file` (not heredoc).
- **Always `--repo pixelelated/distribution`.** Issues are disabled on `ROCKNIX/distribution`, so an unqualified `gh issue create` from this checkout targets a repo that cannot accept it.
- Linked to the original milestone/issues being audited

If labels don't exist, create them first (`gh label create <name> --color <hex>`).

Back-link the issue number/URL from `04-analysis.md` and `05-punch-list.md` before closing out the audit.

### Phase 7 — Resolution gate (mandatory before next phase begins)

**The audit cycle is not complete until every punch-list item has a recorded
outcome.** This is a hard gate: the next phase (or next Epic/Milestone) MUST
NOT begin while punch-list items are in limbo. Picked up via `begin-delivery`
Step 1.6.

For each item in `05-punch-list.md`, one of three outcomes is required:

| Outcome           | What it requires                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **(a) Resolved**  | The fix landed (commit hash recorded in the audit issue task list or in the punch-list file). Verifies the Acceptance criterion stated in the item.                                                                                                                        |
| **(b) Deferred**  | An explicit follow-up issue exists with priority, owner/milestone, and a one-line rationale for the deferral. The Phase 6 audit issue's task list is updated to reference it. Deferrals are allowed but must be **named** — silent rollover into the next phase is banned. |
| **(c) Withdrawn** | The finding was reconsidered and the team explicitly decided no action is needed. A short note in the audit issue records who decided and why. (Rare. Use sparingly.)                                                                                                      |

**Default pattern: resolve in the same session.** Most punch-list items are
small administrative cleanups or codification edits and should land before
the next phase begins. Only escalate to (b) Deferred when the fix is
genuinely larger than the audit cycle can absorb (a real PR, a
cross-service migration, etc.) — and even then, file the follow-up issue
**in the same session** so it cannot evaporate.

### Verify resolutions the way findings are verified

Phase 4.5 attacks every Critical/High **finding** before it is published.
Phase 4.6 hands the whole analysis to the selected frontier model from another
lab, at its pinned effort, to refute and to extend, and the orchestrator
grades every one of its items against the artifact before any reaches the
punch list; a model refuting itself shares its own blind spots, which is
why #186's seat found eleven items the orchestrator had not.
Phase 7 outcomes get the same treatment, because a resolution is a claim like
any other: **re-derive each one from a command before recording it.**

| Outcome claim | What must be run |
| --- | --- |
| "the fix is merged / shipped" | `git branch --contains <sha>` — not memory of having merged |
| "a follow-up issue exists" | `gh issue view <n>` — confirm it is open and says what you think |
| "the body was updated" | re-read it; edits can silently fail |
| "the commit landed" | `git log --oneline -1 <path>` |

The 2026-08-24 run recorded PL-01 as already integrated on the strength of
remembering a merge. The merge was real; it predated the fix. **An outcome
asserted from memory is the same failure the audit exists to find** — see
blindspot 13, "assumed-done" — and it is worse inside an audit, because the
punch list is what everyone downstream trusts.

**Anti-patterns** (banned):

- Recording a Phase 7 outcome from memory rather than from a command
- Creating the Phase 6 issue without a tickable checkbox per punch item —
  the gate then lives in a file nobody is blocked by
- Advancing to the next Epic / next phase while the audit's punch-list
  items are open and unaddressed. The `begin-delivery` skill's Step 1.6 will
  refuse to proceed.
- Closing the audit issue with checkboxes unticked. The Phase 6 audit
  issue stays open until every item is (a)/(b)/(c) and the checkbox is
  ticked accordingly.
- Treating P3 items as auto-deferred. P3 items are usually <15min admin
  cleanups; resolve them in-session by default.

The "complete phase → audit → resolve → begin next phase" loop is the
canonical phase-progression pattern (see the repo's delivery/phase conventions —
e.g. `.claude/rules/issue-tracking.md` — if present).

## Instruction-Recommendations Mode

> **Mode invoked by:** a repo's product-spec audit phase (if the repo uses product specs), or explicit user request ("audit with instruction recommendations", "what instruction files would have prevented this").

When invoked in this mode, the auditor adds a dedicated section to `04-analysis.md` titled **"Instruction File Recommendations"** that surfaces two categories of finding:

| Category                                | What the auditor surfaces                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Coverage gap** — would-have-prevented | For each Phase 2/3 finding, identify the existing instruction file (if any) whose rule, if followed, would have prevented the finding. Format: `Finding F-NN → would have been caught by .claude/rules/{file}.md § {section}` (scaffold's canonical instruction home; no generated mirrors). If a finding maps to no existing instruction file, mark it **"Uncovered"**. |
| **Codification gap** — needs-new-rule   | For each pattern that recurs across 3+ findings AND has no existing instruction file home, recommend either (a) extending an existing instruction file or (b) creating a new one. Format: `Pattern P-NN: {description} (3+ instances). Recommendation: {extend                                                                                                                                                                                    | new file} {target path} § {proposed section}`. Apply the 3+ instances rule — a pattern recurring across 3+ findings (not a one-off) warrants a codified rule. |

### Output format

Append to `04-analysis.md` after the Risk Assessment section:

| P-02: {description} | F-04, F-09, F-15, F-22 | **New file** `.claude/rules/{proposed-name}.md` covering: {scope} |

### Recommended Action Sequence

1. {ordered list of edits the closing agent should make}
```

### Handoff to Phase Z.6

The auditor MUST NOT make instruction-file edits itself in this mode — recommendations are inputs to Phase Z.6 (instruction-file updates), where the closing agent applies them. The auditor's deliverable is the recommendation list with sufficient detail that Z.6 can be executed without re-running the audit.

### When to skip

Skip this mode when the audit scope is a single issue or PR (the 3+ instances rule cannot be evaluated meaningfully at that scope). Always run it for milestone-scope and epic-scope audits — its presence is a row in the recorded quality self-check, so omission is visible drift (adherence had silently decayed to zero between 2026-05-22 and 2026-06-10).

---

## Anti-patterns

Full list in [`references/anti-patterns.md`](references/anti-patterns.md). Top offenders:

- **Rubber-stamping** — marking PASS without reading code
- **Assuming completion** — "issue is closed so it must be done"
- **Summarising without evidence** — "looks good" with no file references
- **Batching notes** — reading 10 files then writing one summary
- **Being helpful instead of accurate** — softening findings to avoid conflict
- **Skipping project conformance** — "this is just a small change"
- **Inventing acceptance criteria** — audit STATED criteria; suggest additions in punch list
- **Tracker-state-only PASS** — issue closed / box checked is corroboration, never sole evidence
- **Verdict from subagent summary** — subagent output is a lead; re-read the primary artifact
- **Delegating terminal ops to subagents** — they don't inherit terminal access
- **Unbounded `gh` output** — always pass `--limit N --json <fields>`

---

## Quality standards for audit artifacts

All output files (00–05) must meet the standards below — and the self-check
against them is RECORDED as a table in `04-analysis.md` (see
`references/templates.md` § Quality self-check), so a skipped check is
visible instead of silent:

| Standard           | Requirement                                                             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Traceability**   | Every finding links to a source (spec section, issue number, file path) |
| **Evidence-based** | No finding without evidence — file paths, line numbers, git commits     |
| **Reproducible**   | Another engineer reading the audit could verify every finding           |
| **Actionable**     | Punch list items specific enough to implement without ambiguity         |
| **Complete**       | Every stated acceptance criterion evaluated — none silently skipped     |

---

## Inputs to gather at the start

| Input                          | Source                                | How to find                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The spec**                   | GitHub issues — there is no `docs/planning/` here | `gh issue view <n> --repo pixelelated/distribution`. Issue bodies *are* the spec; epics link their children |
| **The acceptance criteria**    | Issue bodies                          | The `- [ ]` checklists and any `Acceptance:` line                                               |
| **The issues**                 | `pixelelated/distribution` (upstream has Issues disabled) | `gh issue list --repo pixelelated/distribution`                                                        |
| **The code changes**           | Git history                           | `git log`, `git diff --stat`; note the fork layout — feature branches live in `../rocknix.worktrees/` |
| **Prior findings**             | `docs/work-logs/<yyyy_mm>-work_logs/` | Dated running record of what was done and what went wrong; the closest thing to phase retros    |
| **Blindspot register**         | `docs/blindspot-register.md`          | Proven recurring failure modes — check the work against every entry                             |
| **Prior audits**               | `docs/audits/`                        | Grep by scope and item name                                                                     |
| **Conformance rubric**         | `.claude/rules/*.md` + `CLAUDE.md` | Match by `paths:` glob against changed paths. **Read from `next`**, not a feature worktree |
| **What actually shipped**      | published images / `target/`          | A claim about device behaviour is checked on a device, not in the tree                           |
