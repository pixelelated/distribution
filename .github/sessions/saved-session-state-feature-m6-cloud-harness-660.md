# Session pointer: M6.P2 T13, the cloud test harness (#660)

> **Seeded:** 2026-10-25 by the coordinator (Fable 5.1, lane `m6-coordinator`, D-WORKFLOW-189); the executor updates this file **at every checkpoint** (#1014)
> **Branch:** `feature/m6-cloud-harness-660`, stacked on `feature/m6-p1-survey-641` at `2174265e9c` (which carries the P0 branch); the coordinator's tips merged in (`6aa2fbaadb` at `ef56509d36` (one merge, carrying versions 1 and 2)); the pointer seeded after the second merge
> **Worktree:** `/workspace/repos/pixelelated/distribution.worktrees/m6-cloud-harness-660`; the T1 worktree (`m6-os-launch-control-state-648`) and the #1012 packet's (`m6-1012-ttp-runner`) beside it, idle until their merges; nothing is written there
> **Primary checkout:** `/workspace/repos/pixelelated/distribution` on `next` (D-INFRA-025); the legacy `/workspace/repos/rocknix` and every `rocknix.worktrees/*` are the M7 lane's: read only, no process started there
> **Repository:** `pixelelated/distribution`; every `gh` call carries `--repo pixelelated/distribution`
> **Executor:** Opus 5.5 at high effort (the T1 session, `m6-t1-os-launch`), unless #660 says otherwise
> **Epic:** #1047 (cloud sync and saves: this slice first, then T16 and T17 at Extended depth, which inherit this slice's assertion-shape table); the renovation epic #339; the milestone M6 (D-WORKFLOW-190)
> **Depth:** Independent -- **one seat**, GPT-6 Astra at `max` through the local Facilitator (`tools/council/run invoke --member gpt --provider openrouter`, the one call that sources the key; every other `tools/council/run` call carries `COUNCIL_ENV_FILE=/nonexistent`); the packet scanned before it is sent; a failed seat is a hold
> **The lens:** brittleness, blindspot 31 -- what a PASS from each of the nine tools certifies, by what oracle, and what would have made it FAIL; the assertion-shape table (46 steps and 42 cells of `cloud-round-trip`) is the deliverable T16 waits for
> **The host:** M6's; the M7 lane holds the guest windows; **stage A is host-only** (the four bare tests, the backends up/ls/cat/down, `--list`); **the one guest cycle runs only in a window the coordinator grants on #660** after M7's FINAL RETURN, asked for at the end of stage A with the image, the backends, the cells and the minutes; `TMPDIR` under `/workspace/tmp/m6-t13/`; never `/tmp`; every backend brought down after its run
> **Never:** a handheld, a person's cloud, a hosted account, the maintainer's Dropbox; `cloud-census` run (read only); `--real-roms`; an edit under `tools/` before stage E, or to any file but the nine at stage E; the rule `rclone-cloud-sync.md` (under #909) edited
> **Register:** the three workflow IDs before 209 are the M7 lane's, 209 the coordinator's; a row this slice forces takes D-WORKFLOW-210 or higher, D-QA-064, D-INFRA-032; a row is never edited
> **The brief:** `docs/reviews/briefs/cloud-harness.md` at `6aa2fbaadb` (version 2, after a stranger's proof); #660's body carries its § 7 checkboxes; where the two differ the body wins and the coordinator corrects the brief

## Current focus

**Stage E: S1 done (06:1x UTC, `cloud-test-backend`, 4 commits `0cceb65207` #1058, `94c050ed5a` #1067, `91267b0dda` #1068, `7345a65e9d` #1060's backend half); the S1 checkpoint is posted on #660; S2 (`cloud-round-trip`) next. The brief: `docs/reviews/briefs/t13-streams.md` at `44fdec1e16` (on `feature/m6-renovation-plan-346`; never merged here).**

- The unfixed copy for positives: `/workspace/tmp/m6-t13/unfixed` (a shared clone, `tools/` at `8a2518fa44`). The positives log: `/workspace/tmp/m6-t13/streams-positives.md`, copied into 02 § The streams' positives at each stream's end.
- **S2's order:** #1066, #1060 (harness half: pair every absence check with a successful listing; also fix the `epath()`/`rpath()` docstrings now that SFTP's prefix is empty), #1062, #1063, #1057, #1059 (with PL-15's capabilities), #1064, #1065 (with the `grep -c ... || echo 0` sweep listed in 02), #1069, #1070. One commit per bug, positive first, against a copy at `8a2518fa44` or an extracted function. After S2: `--list` 45 cells and the dead-device case rc 2.
- **S3:** #1061 (T10's patterns via `git show feature/m6-tooling-guards-657:.githooks/secret-patterns`, never merged), #1081.
- **The guest cycle:** its plan is posted on #660 before the grant (controls on the unfixed clone, then the fixed cells, then the suite over WebDAV and SFTP; under 45 minutes). The window opens only on the coordinator's grant.

## Merge notes

Merge order after the M7 candidate: `feature/m6-renovation-plan-346` (P0)
to `next`, then `feature/m6-p1-survey-641` (P1), then T1, T2, T3, T30, T24,
the packets (#877, #890; #887, #889; #905; #1012 after T12's), T5, T6, T7,
T8, T23, T9, T10, T12, **then this branch**, then T14, T15, T45, then T4's
last. When `next` moves, the **coordinator** merges `next` into this
branch, and never between stage A and stage D; the coordinator merges its
own branch into this one at hand-back, before the last criterion's checkers
run. Never merge another lane's feature branch here. Every lane and the M7
lane append to `docs/decision-register.md`, the day's work log and
`docs/work-logs/INDEX.md`: keep every append, regenerate the index, never
edit another lane's rows; a merge with conflicts is checked for leftover
markers before it is committed (#696), and a union of two ledgers is made by
whole entries. Nothing here builds, touches a device, a cloud account, a
hosted provider, a key file, the host's swap, another lane's worktree, or a
guest outside a granted window.
