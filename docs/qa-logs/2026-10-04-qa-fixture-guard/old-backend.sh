# A disposable cloud endpoint for cloud-sync QA, in five protocols.
#
# Serves a directory on this host over WebDAV, S3, SFTP, SMB or FTP. A VM
# started by generic-x64-vm reaches every one of them at 10.0.2.2 (QEMU
# user-mode networking always routes that to the host), so nothing needs
# forwarding and no real cloud account is involved.
#
#   ./tools/cloud-test-backend --backend sftp up
#   CLOUD_QA_BACKEND=sftp ./tools/cloud-test-backend up     # the same thing
#
# WebDAV is the default, because it matches what people actually use.
# Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive are path-based, so SAVES_REMOTE="/GAMES"
# is a folder. On S3 and SMB the first path component is the *bucket* or the
# *share*, so the same setting asks for a bucket named GAMES and fails with
# InvalidBucketName. Every backend states its own three remotes and the
# prefix a caller must strip to address the endpoint directly
# (`saves-remote`, `endpoint-prefix`), so no caller has to know which shape
# it is talking to.
#
# What each one is, and what it cannot do (`caps` prints this per backend):
#
#   webdav  :9010  rclone serve webdav        no hashes, NO MODTIMES
#   s3      :9012  MinIO in a container       MD5 hashes, modtimes, atomic PUT
#   sftp    :9013  an unprivileged sshd       no hashes (no shell), modtimes
#   smb     :9014  Samba in a container       no hashes, modtimes
#   ftp     :9015  pyftpdlib in a venv        no hashes, modtimes
#
# WebDAV with vendor=other is the harshest of the five: with neither hashes
# nor modtimes rclone compares by size alone, which is the shape of #53. The
# other four all carry modtimes, so a change that only WebDAV catches is a
# change WebDAV must keep catching.
#
# Deliberately local, all five: these tests exercise credential stripping and
# backup contents, so a live provider token would be handled by exactly the
# code paths most likely to leak it. Every listener binds 127.0.0.1 (set
# CLOUD_QA_BIND=0.0.0.0 deliberately for a LAN device), and every port is in
# the 9010-9099 range this fork reserves for QA services.
#
#   ./tools/cloud-test-backend up          # start it (CLOUD_QA_BWLIMIT=1M to throttle WebDAV or S3)
#   ./tools/cloud-test-backend reset       # empty it between tests
#   ./tools/cloud-test-backend ls [path]   # what the device actually uploaded
#   ./tools/cloud-test-backend cat <path>  # one uploaded file's bytes
#   ./tools/cloud-test-backend rclone-conf # the stanza to place on a device
#   ./tools/cloud-test-backend caps        # hashes / modtimes / commit shape
