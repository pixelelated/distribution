# vm-upgrade-rehearsal -- the upgrade path, rehearsed in a VM before a handheld
# takes it (upgrade-and-install.md: "boot a VM from the previous image, use it
# enough to create state, then update it in place and confirm that state still
# works").

#
# Boots vm-pair's guest a from the previous image, seeds state a player would
# have -- an auto save and two numbered save states, a battery save, a
# setting, a marker file, a linked cloud (the local QA backend) with a saves
# remote, and a settings backup -- then puts the new tar in /storage/.update,
# reboots, and checks every piece against what was seeded. Every check is a
# PASS/FAIL line; the exit code is 0 only when all pass. The fixture asserts
# its own seeding before the step under test, so a fixture fault cannot be
# booked to the build (2026-09-20, generic-x64-vm-testing.md).
