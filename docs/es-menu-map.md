# EmulationStation menu map

Where every screen lives, so a new feature can be placed rather than invented.
Derived from `es-app/src/guis/` in `ROCKNIX/emulationstation-next` (surveyed
2026-08-19 against the `20260818` build) and verified against the running UI with
`tools/vm-visual-qa`.

Companion documents: [es-ui-style-guide.md](../.claude/rules/es-ui-style-guide.md) — how a screen
should look and behave once you know where it goes; and
[conflict-wizard-ia.md](conflict-wizard-ia.md) — the flow and screen structure
for the cloud-save conflict wizard (#23), now entering implementation — milestone "Cloud Saves: Visual Conflict Resolution".

## Two ways in

EmulationStation has **two** entry points, and they lead to different trees:

| Button | Opens | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **START** | MAIN MENU | Everything configurable |
| **SELECT** | QUICK ACCESS (system view) / VIEW OPTIONS (game list) | Context actions for what is on screen |

Both are built by the same code (`GuiMenu::openQuitMenu_static` serves QUIT and
QUICK ACCESS), which is why QUIT's rows appear inside QUICK ACCESS.

## Main menu

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    START([START button]) --> MM[MAIN MENU]

    MM --> RA[RETROACHIEVEMENTS]:::gated
    MM --> KODI[KODI MEDIA CENTER]:::gated
    MM --> FULL{{full UI only}}
    MM --> QUIT[QUIT]

    FULL --> GS[GAME SETTINGS]

    FULL --> SYS[SYSTEM SETTINGS]

    MM -.kid / kiosk mode.-> KIOSK[INFORMATION<br/>UNLOCK USER INTERFACE MODE]

    classDef gated stroke-dasharray: 4 3
```

In **kid or kiosk mode the entire block above collapses** to INFORMATION,
UNLOCK USER INTERFACE MODE, RETROACHIEVEMENTS (if configured) and QUIT. Anything
you add to the full-UI block simply does not exist for those users — which is the
correct default for configuration, but check it deliberately.

## What lives where

The section headers (`addGroup`) are the real information architecture; use them
to decide where something belongs.

| Destination | Groups it contains |
|---|---|
| **GAME SETTINGS** | TOOLS · ACCOUNTS · BIOS SETTINGS · SAVE STATES · DEFAULT GLOBAL SETTINGS · **CLOUD SETTINGS** · SYSTEM SETTINGS (per-system config) |
| **CONTROLLER & BLUETOOTH** | SETTINGS · BLUETOOTH · DISPLAY OPTIONS · BEHAVIOR · PLAYER ASSIGNMENTS |
| **USER INTERFACE** | APPEARANCE · CONTROL OPTIONS · DISPLAY OPTIONS · GAMELIST OPTIONS · ICONS |
| **GAME COLLECTION** | COLLECTIONS TO DISPLAY · CREATE CUSTOM COLLECTION · OPTIONS |
| **SOUND** | VOLUME · MUSIC · SOUNDS |
| **NETWORK** | INFORMATION · SETTINGS · NETWORK SERVICES · SYNCTHING SERVICES · VPN SERVICES · FINISH RESTORE PROCESS (only after a restore) — *no cloud group; D-UI-015/017* |
| **SCRAPER** | tabbed: SCRAPE · OPTIONS · ACCOUNTS |
| **UPDATES & DOWNLOADS** | DOWNLOADS · SOFTWARE UPDATES (`MANUAL UPDATES` on pixelelated 0.0.1; opens the release-page instructions, with no automatic-update, force or branch controls) |
| **SYSTEM SETTINGS** | SYSTEM · HARDWARE · DEVICE · STORAGE · PERFORMANCE · TWEAKS · SUSPEND · LED HARDWARE · ADVANCED |

Two placement rules the existing tree already follows:

- **Read-only facts come before editable settings.** NETWORK SETTINGS opens with
  an INFORMATION group (IP address, internet status) and only then SETTINGS.
- **Destructive and system-level operations sit behind ADVANCED**, inside SYSTEM
  SETTINGS → SYSTEM MANAGEMENT AND RESET, where every row confirms first.

## Save state manager

A game's long-press menu > SAVE STATES, or before every launch under GAME
SETTINGS > SAVE STATES > SHOW SAVE STATE MANAGER. The tiles are START NEW GAME,
START NEW AUTO SAVE (only while no auto save exists), AUTO SAVE, and one per
numbered slot -- dated and newest first under INCREMENT PER SAVE, `SLOT n` under
DO NOT INCREMENT (D-UI-059). A tile's time follows SHOW CLOCK IN 12-HOUR FORMAT
(D-UI-058) and is said relative to today (D-UI-087, D-UI-089): `TODAY at 17:07`
(`AUJOURD’HUI à 17:07`) for a save from today, `YESTERDAY at 14:03` (`HIER à 14:03`)
for one from yesterday, and the locale's date with a two-digit year for anything
older, `09/22/26 at 14:03`; the word between is lower-case by the maintainer's
word. Since #196 (D-UI-057) the image ships Batocera's
`es_savestates.cfg` entry and the launcher carries Batocera's contract, so
RetroArch does the loading and the saving itself and the interface never parks
or restores a file: **LAUNCH on a numbered slot** starts RetroArch on that slot
(`-e <n>`), which becomes its current slot, and with AUTO SAVE/LOAD on quitting
writes RetroArch's exit auto save as on any other run -- the AUTO SAVE tile
then shows the quit time and the slot's file is untouched (before, the
interface put the pre-launch auto save back and the quit state was lost);
**LAUNCH on AUTO SAVE**, like a plain launch with AUTO SAVE/LOAD on, auto-loads
that file and quitting overwrites it, as before; **START NEW GAME** runs with
the exit auto save and auto-load off for that session, so it still writes no
auto save and the existing one is kept, as upstream. INCREMENTAL SAVE STATES
offers INCREMENT PER SAVE and DO NOT INCREMENT; INCREMENT SLOT went with
Batocera's `001-no-next-slot` patch, under which the launched slot is the
current slot, never the next free one.

## Cloud (our subtree)

As built on 2026-09-12 (ES `51639dd09`; the tree since `af2db4ab09`). One door:
`GAME SETTINGS > CLOUD SETTINGS`. The three save actions sit at that level
because saves move constantly; everything occasional is one row further in,
behind MANAGE CLOUD STORAGE (D-UI-021 lineage; the vocabulary is D-UI-022 and
D-CLOUD-049/050: *saves*, *settings*, *ROMs and BIOS*, *game content*;
*back up* and *restore*, with *sync* reserved for the automatic behaviour,
D-UI-040). `NETWORK
SETTINGS` carries no cloud group. The relink row and its page are called
FINISH RESTORE PROCESS (D-UI-046). Rows are a label and at most one line
under it (D-UI-023); the line under a launching row is how it last went
(`LAST <date> - <outcome>`, D-UI-029), read uncached from
`/storage/.cache/cloud_sync/last-<name>`.

**Interrupted cloud move (#356).** The same folder scan and boot step expose a
retained migration as `TRY AGAIN · NOT NOW`; TRY AGAIN reopens MOVING YOUR CLOUD
FOLDER and resumes the recorded sources. It does not offer KEEP USING an earlier
folder after some pointers already moved. The failure note preserves the partial
outcome: files already moved remain in the new folder. English/French source and
compile checks exist; candidate frames are still required.

**Dialogs the cloud raises on its own.** A restore against a cloud whose saves
folder is missing ends COMPLETED and offers to create it (D-CLOUD-085); when a
folder with a near name sits beside the missing one the dialog names both and
offers CHANGE FOLDER · CREATE ANYWAY · NOT NOW (D-CLOUD-091). Both surfaces
raise it in the same words (`CloudOffer::present`, #145): the card, as it
fades, for the save rows in GAME SETTINGS; the transfer page, when the player
dismisses the done page, for RESTORE FROM THE CLOUD -- until #145 only the
card did, and the fresh handheld's route saw nothing. BACK UP / RESTORE
on a device with no cloud storage asks SET IT UP NOW? and YES opens the list.
FINISH RESTORE PROCESS (after a settings restore) tells the player the backup
never carried the cloud sign-in and points at MANAGE CLOUD STORAGE (D-CLOUD-087).

**Since the cloud epic (#354; D-CLOUD-166/167, 2026-10-01).** The startup and
exit syncs raise no folder question: with no saves folder in the cloud the card
reads SKIPPED - YOUR CLOUD FOLDER ISN'T SET UP YET with SET IT UP: GAME
SETTINGS > MANAGE CLOUD STORAGE, and the row under SYNC SAVES DURING STARTUP
says the same. The question is asked where the player is: on the scan page
that opens BACK UP TO THE CLOUD and RESTORE FROM THE CLOUD (the move of an
earlier /ROCKNIX or /GAMES folder, or the offer to create the current one,
above), at the end of the cloud setup, and on SYNC SAVES WITH THE CLOUD's own
card, which keeps the offer. The transfer page keeps it too, on dismissal, for
a restore run after NOT NOW. SET IT UP NOW? is asked before the scan page, not
at the verb.

**The cloud folder step (#363; D-CLOUD-170, 2026-10-01).** No sync checks the
folder any more; it is settled where the player first meets the cloud. At the
end of cloud setup, before SETTING UP YOUR CLOUD FOLDERS and CLOUD SETUP
COMPLETE, the step scans the folder alone (CHECKING YOUR CLOUD, one item) and,
when an earlier /ROCKNIX or /GAMES holds saves, asks MOVE · KEEP USING … ·
NOT NOW; every way out goes on to the seeding and the last page, and the CLOUD
FOLDER row's own rebuild skips the step. At boot, on a device linked to a
folder an earlier version made its default and not kept, the same step comes
up once the startup sync has ended and nothing else is open -- the carousel or
a game list, no menu, no game -- at every boot until the folder is moved,
kept, followed or created; there an empty earlier folder is offered CREATE IT ·
CHOOSE A FOLDER · NOT NOW as on a restore. Offline at boot it asks FINISH CLOUD
SETUP / YOU'RE NOT ONLINE. CONNECT TO FINISH SETTING UP YOUR CLOUD FOLDER. with
CONNECT TO WI-FI (the WI-FI NETWORKS picker; a network joined runs the step
again) and NOT NOW. One setup page at a time: after a settings restore FINISH
RESTORE PROCESS comes first, its FINISH goes on to the step, and its LATER puts
both off to the next boot. Not in kid or kiosk mode.

**Since RC-11, and since D-UI-078 (#187, #192, #241).** A transfer started from BACK UP TO THE CLOUD, RESTORE FROM THE CLOUD or MATCH runs on a page that owns the screen until it ends; the one way out while it runs is CANCEL, which asks first and names what cancelling means (`WHAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE STAYS. THE NEXT BACKUP OR RESTORE FINISHES WHAT THIS ONE DIDN'T.`), then stops the run and ends the page on `SKIPPED - YOU CANCELLED IT`. (For a week in RC-11 the page could be left with B and the row that launched it followed the run; D-UI-078 reversed that on 2026-09-21 -- "we should only allow things to run in the background when they're fast" -- and this paragraph described the reversed design until audit #258 PL-006.) After the run ends and its page is dismissed, the row that launched it reads `LAST <date> - COMPLETED` (or `COULDN'T FINISH` / `SKIPPED - ...`) until the outcome page has been seen once, then goes back to its one-line description (D-UI-070); the other two rows dim while one is current. Launching a game while a sync runs asks -- the sentence naming it, then STOP IT AND PLAY or KEEP WAITING (D-CLOUD-129 for the sync the player started, since RC-12 build 4; D-CLOUD-130 for the automatic startup and after-a-game syncs, since build 7; until then the first were refused and the second cancelled without asking); the same question guards a transfer that is current, which with the page sat in is not a state a press can reach. The startup card's first step reads `CHECKING THE CONNECTION...` when the interface sees a link and `WAITING FOR A NETWORK, UP TO 60 SECONDS...` when it does not; `SKIPPED - YOU'RE NOT ONLINE` follows the wait as before.

### FINISH RESTORE SETUP (the checklist after a settings restore)

`GuiMenu::openRestoreRelink`, subtitled *RE-ENTER THE PASSWORDS BACKUPS DO NOT
INCLUDE*. It exists because no credential travels in a settings archive
(D-RA-025, D-INFRA-010): `write_archive` deletes every `.key`/`.password`/`.token`
line from the archived `system.cfg` and blanks the same in `retroarch.cfg`, so a
restored device comes back with its configuration and none of its secrets. Each
row is a state row -- a check-circle when the credential is present, an empty
circle when it is not, deliberately never a warning triangle, because "not set
yet" is the expected state on arrival.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    REL{{FINISH RESTORE SETUP<br/><i>RE-ENTER THE PASSWORDS BACKUPS DO NOT INCLUDE</i>}}
    REL --> WIFI[WI-FI PASSWORD<br/><i>first: everything else needs the network back</i>]
    REL --> DEV[DEVICE PASSWORD]
    REL --> NP[NETPLAY PASSWORD<br/><i>only when the restored configuration uses it</i>]
    WIFI --> RECONNECT[reconnects on save, then the page rebuilds]
```

Wi-Fi comes first by design: the sanitised `system.cfg` drops `wifi.key`, so a
settings restore disconnects, and the cloud-journey continuation that follows
this page needs the link back.

## Network (our rows)

`NETWORK SETTINGS > SETTINGS`, as built for #191 (2026-09-15), reworded for
RC-12 build 1 on the maintainer's two calls (D-UI-061, D-UI-062) and reshaped
for build 2 on their third: the phone paradigm (#201, D-UI-063, D-UI-064).
Wi-Fi is NetworkManager: it keeps a profile for every network the device has
joined and autoconnects to whichever saved one is in range, so the network the
device is on and the one the player configured last (`wifi.ssid`) are two
different facts. The row used to show -- and edit -- the setting as though it
were the connection.

- **The WI-FI NETWORK row's value is the network the device is on now**
  (D-UI-063; the label is D-UI-071, WI-FI SSID until RC-12 build 6), asked of NetworkManager (`wifictl current`) off the interface
  thread as the IP ADDRESS and INTERNET STATUS rows are: CHECKING... until
  the answer, then the name, NOT CONNECTED when the device is on none, or
  COULDN'T CHECK when NetworkManager itself did not answer -- two different
  facts, and the row does not read the second as the first. Maintainer,
  2026-09-15: the value should be the connected network, as on a phone. The
  setting `wifi.ssid` still exists and follows the player's choice (the
  picker's connect writes it; `wifictl join` moves it onto the joined
  network from the profile, key included, never printed) so the paths that
  connect from the settings -- the ENABLE WI-FI switch, the restore wizard
  -- name the network the player is on. No line under the label: build 1's
  `CONNECTED TO <other>` line existed only because the value was the
  setting. **No WI-FI KEY row** since D-UI-118 (2026-09-29, taken from
  ROCKNIX's own saved-Wi-Fi work): a key field with no network beside it
  asked "which network's key?"; the two places a key is typed are the
  picker's WI-FI KEY page, per network, and the restore wizard's WI-FI
  PASSWORD page.
- **The picker (WI-FI NETWORKS)** lists the networks in range (`wifictl
  list`, a rescan behind the spinner), the joined one first and marked
  CONNECTED, the ones NetworkManager holds a profile for marked SAVED
  (`WifiText::pickerRows`, unit-tested); a saved network out of range is not
  a row (D-UI-064) -- this list is what can be joined from here. A on a
  saved row opens CONNECT / FORGET / CANCEL (D-UI-118, the second choice
  taken from ROCKNIX's own work; CONNECT first, back lands on CANCEL):
  CONNECT joins it with the key NetworkManager holds (`wifictl join`:
  `nmcli connection up`, then the settings follow, then `pin` prefers it at
  the next boot and resume), FORGET runs the manage page's own confirmation
  and reader (one function, `GuiMenu::forgetWifiNetworkWithConfirmation`)
  and rebuilds the picker; A on the connected row joins it again at once
  (the press confirms or repairs); A on any other row asks for the key (the
  on-screen keyboard; START accepts, empty for an open network) and
  connects at once (`wifictl connect`, a new profile); INPUT MANUALLY takes
  a hidden network's name the same way. On success a toast CONNECTED TO
  <name> and the page is rebuilt so every row reads the connection back;
  failures are dialogs naming the network. Before this, picking a network
  the device had joined before ran `wifictl connect` with whatever key sat
  in the WI-FI KEY row (a row that no longer exists), which deletes the
  saved profile and rebuilds it with that key.
- **MANAGE SAVED NETWORKS** (D-UI-062: "saved" is the maintainer's word and
  `wifictl`'s, and the page, its group and its dialogs use no other) sits
  with the Wi-Fi rows (Wi-Fi on, not LOCAL PLAY MODE). Its page lists
  `wifictl saved` -- NetworkManager's wireless profiles, the one in use
  first as nmcli orders them -- behind a spinner,
  since one nmcli call is one D-Bus round trip to a service that can stop
  answering (#102). A on a row confirms, YES first, so B answers NO; the
  help bar names A FORGET only while there is a network to forget. FORGET
  deletes the profile (`wifictl forget <name>`): the device stops joining
  that network on its own and the password NetworkManager held goes with
  it; `wifi.ssid` and `wifi.key` are untouched, so the network the player
  configured is still one press away in the picker. Forgetting the one in
  use disconnects the device at once (NetworkManager may then join another
  saved network in range), and the toast says so. A list that could
  not be read is a dialog, not an empty page: an empty list and no list are
  different answers, in the script (exit 1) as on the screen.

## RetroAchievements (our rows)

`GAME SETTINGS > RETROACHIEVEMENTS SETTINGS > OPTIONS` carries one row of the
fork's under HARDCORE MODE: OFFLINE ACHIEVEMENTS (BETA) / `Casual achievements

YOU'RE CONNECTED. with STOP IT AND PLAY / KEEP WAITING. Its result is still the
same line under the row, with WHEN YOU CAME ONLINE in place of the date
(D-UI-032).

Since the RC-5 round (#184 notes 3b/5b, D-RA-013) the scan and the top-up
follow the interface's own game index: where a system's games carry a
`cheevosHash` (INDEX NEW GAMES AT STARTUP, INDEX GAMES -- in `gamelist.xml`,
or in `recovery/<system>/` until the next clean exit writes it), only the
games with a `cheevosId` are cached, from that id and hash, the ROM never read
again; a system with no index at all is hashed as before. The top-up caches
every indexed game not yet cached (not only the recently played), and
`ThreadedHasher` runs `raofflineproxy-ctl topup --after-index` as it finishes
with the toggle on, so INDEX NEW GAMES AT STARTUP feeds the cache by itself.
While the toggle is on, the two GAME INDEXES rows on RETROACHIEVEMENTS
SETTINGS carry one line each -- INDEX NEW GAMES AT STARTUP / `Also saves new
games' achievement data for offline play.`, INDEX GAMES / `Also saves their
achievement data for offline play.` -- and so does FIND ALL GAMES WITH
NETPLAY/ACHIEVEMENTS under DEVELOPER > TOOLS; off, the rows read as
upstream's. The stamp gains `indexed=<n>`, which the page passes over.

**Elsewhere, cloud-adjacent.** `SYSTEM SETTINGS > SYSTEM MANAGEMENT AND RESET`:
DATA MANAGEMENT (back up / restore settings to this device), EMULATOR
MANAGEMENT and SYSTEM MANAGEMENT (the resets) run headless behind a spinner and
end in an outcome dialog (D-UI-037). `SCRAPER > ACCOUNTS` carries DEVELOPER ID /
DEVELOPER PASSWORD beside the account (#64; the map said OPTIONS until
2026-09-29, `GuiScraperStart::loadAccountsPage` says ACCOUNTS). The startup sync is a card at
boot; the exit sync a card after a game; both end on the card (D-UI-028, with
`COMPLETED WITH GAPS` removed by D-UI-030 -- a run passes or fails). A launch
cancels either **in what ships today** (D-CLOUD-076); **D-CLOUD-109 replaces
that** with a bounded wait, so this line changes when #22/#135 land. Since
2026-09-26 (#292, D-RA-030) the link's return has cards of its own: SENDING
OFFLINE ACHIEVEMENTS... with the count, ending OFFLINE ACHIEVEMENTS HAVE BEEN
SENT (or COULDN'T FINISH - RETROACHIEVEMENTS STOPPED ANSWERING), when the proxy
holds awards or has just sent some; then SYNCING SAVES TO THE CLOUD when the
last exit sync was skipped for no network. A launch over the send asks
OFFLINE ACHIEVEMENTS ARE BEING SENT. / IT'LL BE A MOMENT. with PLAY NOW / KEEP
WAITING (the send is the proxy's and goes on behind the game). The exit card
no longer says anything about achievements. Each card stamps what it said
(`last-sync-link`, beside `last-sync-exit` and `last-sync-startup`).

Anything measured in minutes runs in `GuiCloudTransfer`, not a card
(`es-native-ui.md`, the fourth *surface* tier -- not one of the four data
tiers above). Exit 75 from any script means another
sync held the lock and exit 69 means there was no network (sysexits'
`EX_TEMPFAIL` and `EX_UNAVAILABLE`, codes rclone cannot return -- #99); both
are shown as SKIPPED, not FAILED.

**Keep this map current.** Maintainer, 2026-09-11: it is *"something we were
maintaining closely and should still do"* -- every row added, moved or renamed
in EmulationStation updates this file in the same change (D-UI-039). Pending
here, to be drawn when the rows are built (#134, #23): under SAVE MANAGEMENT one
entering row, EARLIER VERSIONS OF SAVES (D-UI-043: about keeping, no restore verb),
opening a nested page that holds KEEP EARLIER VERSIONS OF SAVES (switch)
and VERSIONS KEPT PER SAVE (count) -- the two #23 rows, reworded for the whole
store (D-CLOUD-095/096, D-UI-039); and, after a conflict, the compare page with
the cloud's version left and this console's right, a *played later/earlier on
<console>* line under each, the cursor opening on the newer one (D-CLOUD-104).

## Not mapped

Upstream Batocera pages this fork neither wrote nor modifies. They are listed
rather than omitted so the check (`tools/es-menu-map-check`) can tell a page we
decided not to document from a page somebody forgot — and so that the day we add
a row to one of them, the declaration is where the reader will trip over it.
**Adding a row to any of these means mapping it above and deleting its line
here.** The reason column is the point; a line with no reason is not a decision.

- SYSTEM OPTIONS -- upstream system page; ROCKNIX adds no row to it
- SECURITY -- upstream; the SSH/root-password surface we use in the wizard is mapped above instead
- FRONTEND DEVELOPER OPTIONS -- upstream diagnostics, not a player surface
- PER SYSTEM ADVANCED CONFIGURATION -- upstream per-emulator tree, unchanged here
- EMULATOR SETTINGS -- upstream per-system emulator/core choice, unchanged here
- LATENCY REDUCTION -- upstream run-ahead page, unchanged here
- MULTISCREENS -- upstream; no ROCKNIX handheld has a second screen
- DECORATIONS -- upstream bezel page; settings backups carry bezels but the page is theirs
- DMD -- upstream pinball display integration, not built for our devices
- FORMAT DEVICE -- upstream storage tool, unchanged here
- SAFELY EJECT A DISK -- upstream storage tool, unchanged here
- KODI SETTINGS -- upstream; Kodi is not in our images
- FAVORITE SONGS -- upstream background-music picker, unchanged here
- SCREENSAVER SETTINGS -- upstream screensaver page, unchanged here
- AI GAME TRANSLATION -- upstream feature, not configured on our images
- SCREENSCRAPER -- upstream scraper page; our fork's change is the developer pair inside it (#64), not the page's shape
- NETPLAY SETTINGS -- upstream netplay page, unchanged here
- CONNECT TO NETPLAY -- upstream netplay browser, unchanged here
- ADD TO CUSTOM COLLECTION... -- upstream collections flow, unchanged here
- GLOBAL HOTKEYS -- upstream hotkey editor, unchanged here
- JOYSTICKS HOTKEYS -- upstream hotkey editor, unchanged here
- KEYBOARDTOPADS -- upstream key-to-pad editor; #63 will move its tab strip to the focus model, which does not change where it lives
- ANALOG STICKS LEDS -- upstream LED page for controllers our devices do not have
- PAIR A BLUETOOTH DEVICE -- upstream pairing flow, unchanged here

## pixelelated identity (0.0.1)

The screenshot toggle in System Settings reads **ENABLE pixelelated SCREENSHOT**;
its persisted `rocknix.screenshot.enabled` setting is unchanged.
The system menu version line and manual-update destination use lowercase
pixelelated (D-WORKFLOW-144, #409). This is a name change within the same rows.
