# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

pixelelated is an **immutable Linux distribution for handheld gaming devices** (a ROCKNIX/JELOS fork
built on the LibreELEC/CoreELEC cross-compilation system). There is no app to run — this
repo is a *build system* that cross-compiles a complete OS image (kernel, bootloader,
emulators, userland) per device.

**Resuming work, or new to the project?** Read `.github/sessions/saved-session-state-next.md`
on `next` first: the work in flight, what is running, the next commands, and a walk-through
for an agent who has never seen the project (D-WORKFLOW-133). A session loads the rules of the
worktree it starts in, so check that yours carries `next`'s before trusting any of them:
`git diff --quiet next -- .claude CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md || echo STALE` -- then merge `next` into
a feature worktree, or read the rules from `next` (#367).

**Canonical deep-dive docs (this file summarizes; they are authoritative):**
- `AGENTS.md` — fork workflow and non-obvious gotchas, for agents that read it instead of this file.
- `packages/README.md` — the authoritative `package.mk` format reference.
- `.claude/rules/*.md` — the canonical scoped guides, **loaded automatically**: a rule with a
  `paths:` glob loads when a matching file enters context, one without loads every session.
  All 30 of them, indexed in `instruction-files.md` (which also carries the front-matter
  standard, D-WORKFLOW-009), so nothing is reachable only by accident:

  | Always (no glob, or `paths: "**"`) | Scoped |
  | --- | --- |
  | `least-surprise` · `player-language` · `time-to-play` · `vm-first` · `bugs-are-agent-first` — the four principles every interface and sync decision is weighed against | `packaging-and-patches` (`packages/**`, `projects/**`) |
  | `es-native-ui` · `es-player-text` · `es-ui-style-guide` · `es-code-traps` — the EmulationStation four: the mechanics · the words a player reads · how a screen looks · the codebase's sharp edges (D-WORKFLOW-007/008) | `rclone-cloud-sync` (the rclone package, `rocknix/sources/scripts`, the cloud tools) |
  | `engineering-practices` · `upgrade-and-install` · `documentation-accuracy` | `generic-x64-vm-testing` (GENERIC_X64, `projects/ROCKNIX/packages/**`, the VM tools) |
  | `fork-workflow` · `worktrees` · `device-builds` · `release-candidates` · `issue-tracking` · `decision-register` · `learning-capture` · `instruction-files` · `ceremonies` · `working-principles` | `handheld-evidence` (device packages, device kernels, `docs/**`) |
  | `adversarial-council` | `council-substrate-integrity` (council artifacts and skills) |
  | | `change-log` (`projects/ROCKNIX/packages/**`, the running change log) |

  Two more documents carry interface law and load *nowhere*: `docs/es-menu-map.md`
  (where a row belongs — and D-UI-039: a row added, moved or renamed updates it in the
  same change) and `docs/conflict-wizard-ia.md` (the wizard's IA). Open them when the
  work is theirs; `es-native-ui.md` says which owns what.

## Current project identity

The next RC is **pixelelated**, always lowercase (D-WORKFLOW-144).
GitHub organization: `pixelelated`; maintainer: `rasteratops`; developer:
`blitterbot`, unchanged. Rasteratops is a character, not the OS name.
Use `/pixelelated` for new cloud setups (D-CLOUD-174/175).
The required OS adoption path is ROCKNIX → pixelelated; no
fielded Rasteratops migration gate exists. Preserve ROCKNIX stored interfaces,
upstream credits and historical evidence. See `NAMING.md` and
`docs/pixelelated/rename-plan.md` before identity changes.

Cloud setup uses normal linking and explicit folder selection (D-CLOUD-175).
Fresh configurations use `/pixelelated`; existing credentials and selected paths
stay unchanged. Retire automatic cloud-folder migration and legacy joining or
following under #508; users populate or rearrange their cloud folders themselves.
OS upgrade preservation and normal sync/restore testing still apply.

## Build & development commands

Builds are driven by `PROJECT` (default `ROCKNIX`), `DEVICE`, and `ARCH`. Per-device make
targets exist for: `RK3588`, `RK3576`, `RK3566`, `RK3326`, `RK3399`, `S922X`, `SM6115`,
`SM8250`, `SM8550`, `SM8650`, `SM8750`, `H700`, `AMD64` (see `Makefile`; most build both
`arm` and `aarch64`). `make world` builds the primary device set.

Docker is the recommended way to build:

```bash
make docker-image-pull                   # pull Rasteratops mirror at Makefile's pinned digest
make docker-RK3588                       # full image build for a device
make docker-shell                        # interactive shell in the build container
PACKAGE=retroarch make docker-package    # build one package in the container
```

Native equivalents (run from a path **without spaces**, **never as root**):

```bash
make RK3588                              # device image build
./scripts/build <package>                # build ONE package
./scripts/clean <package>                # clean ONE package so it rebuilds
make kconfig-menuconfig-RK3588           # edit a device's kernel config
scripts/checkdeps                        # verify host build dependencies
```

Fast dev loop — rebuild one package, then remake the image instead of a full build:

```bash
make docker-shell                        # skip when building natively
export PROJECT=ROCKNIX DEVICE=RK3588 ARCH=aarch64
./scripts/clean <pkg> && ./scripts/build <pkg>
./scripts/install <pkg> && ./scripts/image mkimage   # needs OS_VERSION/BUILD_DATE exported
```

Native image/package entrypoints and Docker build targets automatically use
`tools/watch-build` and the shared `tools/watch-job` monitor. Each run prints
its private `.build-runs/<id>/` log, PID, result and status location; nested
commands reuse it. For an ad-hoc command use `tools/watch-build -- COMMAND`.
Status recording does not send automatic chat notifications. See
`device-builds.md` for lifecycle and frozen-checkout handling.
Long jobs also need verified result delivery; until off-session alerts are
configured, supervise actively and announce completion promptly (#395).

Images land in `target/` (`config/path` sets `TARGET_IMG=$ROOT/target`). Deploy to a
networked device by `scp`-ing the image tar to `root@<host>:~/.update` and rebooting
(preserves settings).

**Testing/lint:** there is **no unit-test suite**. `tools/pkgcheck <package>` is the only
lint — run it after every `package.mk` edit. The real test is that the package/image builds.
A first build needs ~200GB disk and hours; cached rebuilds take minutes.

## Architecture

**Layered config resolution** (`config/options`): options are sourced in order —
`distributions/<DISTRO>/options` → `projects/<PROJECT>/options` →
`projects/<PROJECT>/devices/<DEVICE>/options` → `config/arch.<ARCH>` — each layer
overriding the last. Device knobs (CPU flags, kernel target, bootloader, GPU family) live
in the device `options` file.

**Package override model:** every package is a directory with a `package.mk`. A
`package.mk` under `projects/<PROJECT>/packages/...` or
`projects/<PROJECT>/devices/<DEVICE>/...` overrides the generic one of the same name in
`packages/`. `DEVICE_ROOT` lets one device reuse another's build root.

**Directory roles:**
- `packages/` — generic cross-project package recipes, grouped by function.
- `projects/<PROJECT>/` — SoC/vendor families (`ROCKNIX`, `Rockchip`, `Qualcomm`, ...): device `options`, package overrides, `patches/`, `filesystem/` overlays, `bootloader/`.
- `distributions/ROCKNIX/` — distro identity (version, options, splash).
- `scripts/` — the build engine (`build_distro`, `build`, `clean`, `install`, `image`).
- `tools/` — dev helpers (`pkgcheck`, `distro-tool`, `adjust_kernel_config`).
- `build.*/`, `sources/`, `release/`, `target/` — gitignored build outputs.

**Emulator naming:** libretro cores are `*-lr`; standalone emulators are `*-sa`
(`projects/ROCKNIX/packages/emulators/`).

## `package.mk` rules (see `packages/README.md` for the full reference)

- **Late-binding (enforced by `pkgcheck`):** toolchain/path vars (`CC`, `CFLAGS`, `PKG_BUILD`, `TARGET_*`, ...) exist only *after* the package loads — reference them **only inside functions** (`configure_package`, `pre_configure_target`, ...), never at global scope.
- Customize via `pre_*`/`post_*` hook functions rather than replacing core build steps; branch per device with `case ${DEVICE} in ... esac`.
- Preserve upstream JELOS/LibreELEC copyright headers and add a ROCKNIX line — this is a fork; credits must be retained.
- Pin git sources with the **full** commit hash in `PKG_VERSION`.
- Patches in a package's `patches/` dir auto-apply after unpack; scope per device with `patches/<DEVICE>/`. Kernel patches live under `packages/linux/patches/<DEVICE>/`; hardware quirks under `projects/ROCKNIX/packages/hardware/quirks/`.

## Commit conventions

No Conventional Commits. Scope by package or device, matching history:
`azahar-sa - bump to ...`, `SM8250 - linux - enable ntsync`, `emulationstation: bump package`.
**Upstream PR commits are stricter** (CI-enforced): `package: text` title matching
`^[a-zA-Z0-9_*./-]+:[[:space:]].+$`, ≤72 chars, blank line before body, no merge commits.

## Fork workflow (this working copy is a fork)

`origin` = `pixelelated/distribution`, `upstream` = `ROCKNIX/distribution`. Full rules in
`fork-workflow.md` / `worktrees.md`; essentials:

- Branch `next` = `upstream/next` + a personal overlay (`.claude/rules/`, `docs/`, `plans/`, `.githooks/`, ...). **Never PR `next` upstream.**
- Feature work: branch `feature/<name>` from `next` in a worktree at `../rocknix.worktrees/<name>`; the primary checkout stays on `next`.
- Upstream PRs use a throwaway branch built **by content**: `git checkout next -- <the feature paths>` onto a detached `upstream/next`, one commit. The old `git rebase --onto upstream/next next pr/<name>` recipe is retired — it produces an empty branch, silently, once the feature has been merged into `next`. `.githooks/pre-push` guards `pr/*`; it is the backstop, not the plan.
- Issues go on the fork: always `gh --repo pixelelated/distribution` (upstream has Issues disabled).
- The milestone body is the current ordered plan: current/next work, dependencies and exit evidence. Keep open titles aligned as `M7.P1: ...`; M comes from the milestone name, P from its body. Update both when priorities change; preserve closed titles (`milestone-phase-naming.md`, D-WORKFLOW-139).
- User-facing behavior changes need a follow-up docs PR to the separate `ROCKNIX/rocknix.org` repo.
- Durable lessons: consider an instruction file under `.claude/rules/` and append a timestamped entry to `docs/work-logs/<yyyy_mm>-work_logs/<yyyy_mm_dd>-work_log.md`. A learning that is a *procedure* becomes a tool or a flag, not prose (`learning-capture.md` § 3).
- Decisions go in `docs/decision-register.md` the same session they are made, and are cited by ID rather than re-argued; the table is **append-only** (`decision-register.md`). Out-of-band maintainer requests become fork issues the same session, quoting their words (`issue-tracking.md`, D-QA-012).

## Non-obvious gotchas

- Script-only changes (e.g. `scripts/mkimage`) do **not** trigger an image rebuild — delete `build.*/.stamps/image/build_target` first.
- Building from a git worktree in Docker requires mounting the main repo's `.git`: `DOCKER_EXTRA_OPTS='-v <main-repo>/.git:<main-repo>/.git'`.
- A network/download failure during a build often surfaces as a **misleading, unrelated-looking build error** — check for failed downloads first.
- Before "fixing" apparently wrong code, verify design intent via `git log -S`/`git blame` — several dangerous-looking patterns are intentional (`engineering-practices.md`).
- `emulationstation` source lives in a separate git repo; see `projects/ROCKNIX/packages/ui/emulationstation/package.mk` for the extra build steps.
- **Clarity, then brevity, then sized to the space** for every string a player reads, and surprise them as little as possible — `player-language.md` (D-UI-045) and `least-surprise.md` (D-UI-042), beside `time-to-play.md` (D-CLOUD-098): interface → first frame and exit → next first frame are measured on every image, and nothing goes on the launch path unless it must.
- **Vocabulary is not decoration.** Four tiers (settings; saves; ROMs and BIOS; game content), two verbs (*back up*, *restore*), *sync* reserved for the automatic behaviour, "Wi-Fi" hyphenated, the serial comma, *game save* vs *save state* — `es-player-text.md` § Conventions, D-UI-022. Only "back up" vs "backup" is checked mechanically (`tools/vocabulary-check`, the `vocabulary` suite of `tools/vm-qa`).
- **Every build ships onto devices that already have state.** Before publishing, check both the upgrade path (a device keeping its `/storage`) and a clean install — see `upgrade-and-install.md`. A fix that changes what we *write* does nothing for what is already written.
- **Can this be done on the VM?** Asked and answered in writing, in the issue, before
  every test, proof or measurement; only a reasoned no (a real panel, a board's memory,
  a battery, a GPU path) moves it off the VM, and "a real provider" is not a no
  (`vm-first.md`, D-QA-007/017).
- **A handheld is a person's device, and its cloud is their data.** Nothing runs on one
  without a per-action yes: not a reboot, not a game launch, not injected input, not a
  screenshot, not a sync or upload, not a deletion in their cloud. A general offer of
  device testing is not a standing yes; each test is asked for by name with what it
  writes, sends and leaves behind. Reads need no question. `engineering-practices.md`
  § "Nothing runs on a person's device without their yes", D-QA-015, blindspot 38,
  `docs/device-testing-policy.md`.
- **Physical-device flashing** — follow `docs/device-flashing-runbook.md` (pointed to from `device-builds.md`): identify the removable card at run time and exclude every system disk; read the raw image back before touching its filesystem; on H700 a fresh card does not boot until the exact device tree is activated as `/dtb.img`.
- **rclone cloud-sync** and **GENERIC_X64 VM QA** have sharp edges — read their instruction files before touching those areas (filter file is an allowlist; `--delete-excluded` is catastrophic; VM disk must be 16GB+ or first boot breaks in a way that looks like a graphics bug).
- **A worktree is removed with `tools/fork-worktree remove`**, never `git worktree remove --force` — it cannot tell a few hundred MB of checkout from hours of un-recoverable build output (`worktrees.md`, D-WORKFLOW-005).
- **Read `.claude/rules/` from `next`, not from your feature worktree.** Feature branches cut from an older base silently lack instruction files added since — the four ES rule files (`es-native-ui`, `es-player-text`, `es-ui-style-guide`, `es-code-traps`) are absent from older worktrees, so ES work done there proceeds without the guidance they mandate.
- **Headless VM QA** (no desktop on the build host): `generic-x64-vm run --headless --daemonize <qcow2>`, then `tools/vm-serial` for a root shell and `tools/vm-visual-qa` with `tools/vm-walks/` for the screen. SSH is disabled on a fresh image, so serial is the way in; stop the VM by its pidfile, never by `pkill` pattern. Details and the keys in `generic-x64-vm-testing.md`.
